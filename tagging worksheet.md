# 🏷️ Worldmaking Canon — Git Tagging Reference

### Purpose
Tags mark **canonical milestones** in the evolution of the *Worldmaking Canon* (WCB).  
They serve as **version anchors** for published states, major merges, and archival snapshots —  
distinct from commit messages, which record the *narrative of work.*

## 🔧 Tag Format

```text
canon_v{major}.{minor}.{patch}_{topic}
