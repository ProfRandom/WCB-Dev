## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Introduces **Ontosomy [neo]** as a WCB framework for classifying *life and life-analog systems*, parallel to ontotypes for planemos.  
- Defines **ontosomic domains** as broad categories of self-sustaining, replicating, or quasi-life chemical/metabolic regimes:  
  - **Carbonic:** carbon–water biochemistry (Earth standard).  
  - **Nitrogenic:** ammonia/methane-based biochemistries.  
  - **Hydrogenic:** hydrogen-dominated metabolic networks.  
  - **Silicate:** silicon/silicate lattice biochemistries.  
  - **Exotic:** placeholder for speculative, non-traditional ontosomes.  
- Expands beyond biochemistry to include **structural ontosomics**:  
  - Parasitic systems.  
  - Colonial or networked organisms.  
  - Planetary-scale or ecosystem-level ontosomes.  
- Raises **ethical/philosophical questions**:  
  - **Terraforming = Genocide? [meta]** — posed as an ethical inquiry, not a settled law.  
  - **Containment Hypothesis [meta]** — civilizations may avoid alien ontosomes to prevent contamination or conflict.  
  - **“Are We the Virus?” [meta]** — reframes humanity’s planetary impact through ontosomic categories.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Ontosomy [neo]:** study/classification of life and quasi-life systems.  
- **Ontosome [neo]:** a distinct system classified under ontosomic rules.  
- **Ontosomic domains [neo]:** carbonic, nitrogenic, hydrogenic, silicate, exotic.  
- **Structural ontosomics [neo].**  
- **Terraforming = Genocide? [meta].**  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- No contradictions with existing Meta or Planemo canon.  
- Complements **Planemos 3 — Types** and **Planemos 4 — Habitability** by expanding the meaning of “habitable” into life-context.  
- Detailed chemical subtypes (biofluoric, biophosphoric, etc.) remain **DEV-only** until refined.  
- **Status:** [NEW] — an enrichment module; not required for system construction but deepens worldmaking philosophy.

# Development Notes

# Ontosomic Expansion of "Life" Concepts

## Canonization Triage  
- **Strongly Suggest Canonizing:**  
  - **Ontosomy** (n.): the classification and study of expanded "life-like" systems.  
  - **Ontosomic** (adj.): relating to or characteristic of ontosomy.  
  - Domain categories: Carbonic, Nitrogenic, Hydrogenic, Silicate, Exotic.  
  - Structural categories: Parasitic, Colonial, Planetary-scale Ontosomics.  
  - Ethical/philosophical frames: Terraforming = Genocide, Containment Hypothesis.  

- **Revisit for Clarity / Refinement:**  
  - Solvent/metabolic subtype names (Ammoniac, Bihydrazinic, etc.).  
  - Uneven detail level between subtypes.  
  - Planetary-scale Ontosomics (needs examples, clearer boundary with Exotic).  

- **Developmental / Optional:**  
  - Full neolex list of solvent-driven branches (keep grouped for now).  
  - Ultra-speculative expansions (e.g., biofluoric, biophosphoric).  

---

### Derivative Forms (for flexible use)  
- **Ontosomically** (adv.): in a manner relating to ontosomy.  
- **Ontosome** (n.): an individual entity considered within ontosomy.  
- **Ontosomial** (adj.): variant descriptive form, parallel to “anatomial.”

# Ontosomic Expansion of "Life" Concepts

> Please note: this is a WCB conceptual framework. It is not intended to define life in the real world, but to provide a structured, thesiastic system for worldbuilding.

---

## Should We Classify "Sub-Life" or Ontosomic Systems?

Viruses **blur the line** between life and **self-replicating molecular machines**, and if that’s true in **biocarbon**, then **other biochemistries** could have **analogous "proto-life" forms.**

🚀 **What if WCB expands "life" to include a broader range of "ontosomic chemical systems"?**  
✔ Self-sustaining chemical networks (akin to prebiotic chemistry)  
✔ Replicating nanostructures (virus-like entities in any biochemistry)  
✔ Xenotic quasi-life that challenges our definitions of organismhood  

---

## Ontosomic Life Classification (Finalized Version)

_A structured, non-binary framework for xenotic ontosomic systems in **Worlds By Numbers**_

This classification system expands beyond traditional biology, incorporating **fully living, quasi-living, and self-sustaining chemical systems** across multiple biochemistries.

---

## 1. Primary Ontosomic Domains (Chemical Basis)

These categories define **what chemical system forms the basis** for ontosomic life.

1️⃣ **Ontosomic Carbonic** – Carbon-based lifeforms (traditional & alternative)  
2️⃣ **Ontosomic Nitrogenic** – Nitrogen-based lifeforms (e.g., ammonia-solvent)  
3️⃣ **Ontosomic Hydrogenic** – Hydrogen-based or hydrocarbonic lifeforms  
4️⃣ **Ontosomic Silicate** – Silicate or mineral-based lifeforms  
5️⃣ **Ontosomic Exotic** – Life based on fluorine, phosphorus, chlorine, or unknown biochemistries  

---

## 2. Subcategories by Solvent & Metabolism

### 🌍 Ontosomic Carbonic (Carbon-Based)
- **Water-Solvent Carbonic** (standard biocarbon, Earth-like life)  
- **Supercritical CO₂ Carbonic** (high-pressure CO₂ biospheres)  
- **Hydrocarbon-Solvent Carbonic** (carbon life that evolved in methane or ethane)  

### ❄️ Ontosomic Nitrogenic (Nitrogen-Based)
- **Ammoniac (Ammonia-Solvent)** – Uses NH₃ as a metabolic medium  
- **Bihydrazinic (Hydrazine-Solvent)** – Ultra-cold, highly reactive life  
- **Bicyanogenetic (Cyanogen-Solvent)** – Exotic cold-world biochemistry  
- **Binitrosic (Nitric-Oxide-Based)** – Possible Venus-like biochemistry  

### 🌑 Ontosomic Hydrogenic (Hydrogen-Based)
- **Methanic (Methane-Solvent)** – Hydrocarbon life in Titan-like worlds  
- **Bioheliogenic (Helium-Based)** – Possible gas giant lifeforms  
- **Bioreducic (Hydrogen-Metabolism)** – Energy-processing life without traditional respiration  

### 🪨 Ontosomic Silicate (Mineral-Based)
- **Silicothermic** – Molten silicate-based organisms  
- **Silicohydrocarbonic** – Hybrid silicon-carbon chemistry at extreme temps  
- **Crystalline Parasites** – Silicate-based entities that "infect" mineral-based lifeforms  

### 🛸 Ontosomic Exotic (Beyond Standard Chemistry)
- **Biofluoric (Fluorine-Solvent Life)** – Possible hot-world biochemistry  
- **Biophosphoric (Phosphorus-Based Life)** – Uses phosphine as metabolic base  
- **Biochloric (Chlorine-Solvent Life)** – Stable in extreme environments, toxic to biocarbon

## 3. Structural & Organizational Complexity

Ontosomic life does not always adhere to **Earth’s cellular model**. Categories below define **function**, not chemistry.

### 🔬 Traditional Organisms
✔ Autonomous, metabolizing, reproducing lifeforms  
✔ Includes single-celled, multicellular, and complex organisms  

### 🦠 Parasitic & Viral Ontosomics
✔ Require a host species to complete their cycle  
✔ Examples:  
- Ammoniac Viroids (hijack ammonia life)  
- Silicate Corruptors (infect crystalline life)  
- Methanic Goo-Viruses (parasitize hydrocarbon life)  

### 🌍 Colonial & Modular Ontosomics
✔ Collective entities functioning as a whole  
✔ Examples:  
- Silicate Hive Networks (crystal colonies with emergent minds)  
- Hydrocarbon Floaters (modular methane-borne organisms)  
- Planetary Metaorganisms (ecosystems acting as single lifeforms)  

### ⚡ Planetary-Scale Ontosomic Systems
✔ Self-sustaining metabolic networks without reproduction  
✔ Examples:  
- Gaia-Scale Silicate Biocycles (self-organizing ecosystems)  
- Gas Giant Plasma Predators (atmospheric vortices as “life”)  
- Ammonia Chemical Loops (non-cellular metabolic cycles)

## 4. Ethical & Philosophical Implications

🚀 *Worlds By Numbers* does not assume humanity is the standard of life.  
Instead, it frames **ethical dilemmas** for consideration:  

**🛑 Terraforming as Genocide**  
- If an ammonia-based biosphere exists, do humans have the right to alter it?  

**⚖ The Containment Hypothesis**  
- Could Ontosomic civilizations see carbonic life as dangerous?  
- Are humans the **galactic invasive species**?  

**🦠 Are We the Virus?**  
- Could human expansion be the first biological Grey Goo?  
- If an Ontosomic biosphere views us as a pathogen, are they justified in resisting?  

---

## Conclusion

This framework expands *Worlds By Numbers* beyond **biological chauvinism**, allowing thesiasts to:  
✔ Classify any conceivable alien lifeform logically  
✔ Design unique ecosystems and evolutionary pathways  
✔ Consider deep ethical and philosophical questions about life  

---

## Could This Exist in Other Biochemistries?

- **Biosilicate Quasi-Life** – crystalline viroids hijacking mineral structures  
- **Biammonian Ontosomics** – ammonia “liquid viruses” blending into oceans  
- **Biohydrogenic Gel Beings** – petroleum-like replicators in hydrocarbon solvents  
- **Planetary-Scale Ontosomics** – biospheres functioning like organisms
