## 📎 Sidebar: Non-Co-Planar Orbits

For teaching clarity, we currently **assume Rashid and Hierax orbit in the same plane** as Rosetta’s equator.  
- ✅ This makes their declination vary only with Rosetta’s obliquity (axial tilt).  
- ✅ Rise/set azimuths and eclipse/transit geometry stay predictable.  
- ✅ Fits neatly into the **Azimuthal Intersection Workflow**.

👋 **But if you want more realism:**  
- Real moons often have **inclinations** relative to their planet’s equator.  
- Their declination, $\delta$, then varies not just with obliquity but also with orbital inclination ($i$) and the longitude of the ascending node $\Omega$:
$$
\delta \approx \arcsin\!\big(\sin i \cdot \sin(\lambda + \Omega)\big) \;+\; \epsilon \cos(2 \pi Z_f)
$$
- This can cause:  
  - Moons that **skim the horizon** at certain latitudes.  
  - Moons that **“vanish”** from view for part of their orbit.  
  - Irregular eclipse/transit opportunities.

Use this only if you want to explore **advanced sky mechanics**. For most WCB work, co-planarity is the simpler and more teachable assumption.

- Tidal locking.    
- Retrograde/prograde motion (decide if either is captured).
