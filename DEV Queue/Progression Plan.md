## Circumstellar Debris Architecture

Beyond the principal planemons, a typical stellar system hosts multiple belts and populations of small star system bodies (S³Bs). These define the system’s **debris architecture** — the non-planetary mass components distributed through its Hill domain.

### 1. Inner Belt
Composed primarily of **stony micromons and minimons** (asteroidal class).  
Resonant gaps form where orbital periods meet integer ratios with interior planemons.

### 2. Co-Orbital Swarms (Triolocs)
Stable collections of bodies at ±60° from a planemon’s mean anomaly — analogs to the Solar System’s Trojans and Greeks.  
In parensic terms, these occupy *trioloc equilibria* near L₄ and L₅ of the planemon–primaron system.

### 3. Transitional Zone (Centaurs)
Bodies in dynamically unstable orbits crossing those of outer planemons.  
Typical lifetimes: 10⁶–10⁷ years. Often sources for volatile transfer or impact-driven terraforming.

### 4. Outer Belt
Icy or silicate–ice composites extending beyond the last major planemon.  
Analogous to the Kuiper Belt; bounded roughly by the primaron’s *outer baryloc*.

### 5. Detached Reservoir (Scattered Disk)
High-eccentricity bodies with perihelia beyond the last planemon’s aphelion; dynamically linked to past baryonic perturbations.

### 6. Oort Halo
Quasi-spherical shell of icy micromons and minimons extending to the system’s Hill boundary.  
Forms the **syllipsic frontier**: objects here are weakly bound and often exchanged between neighboring stellar systems.

---

### Canonical Notes
- Collectively, these regions may contain more *total objects* than all planemons combined, though only a small fraction of total system mass.  
- WCB classifies these structures morphotypically, not as separate dynamical classes: belts, halos, triolocs, and debris planes are *arrangements* of S³Bs within a primaron’s Hill domain.

# From Volume 5-5e
Expand on Lagrange points

## Lagrange Equilibria in Parenson Systems

Within a parenson (where one monon orbits a more massive primeron), five points exist where the gravitational and inertial forces balance in a rotating frame. These **Lagrange points** define regions of quasi-stability or metastability around the barycenter.

| Symbol | Canonical Name | Relation to System Geometry | Stability Type |
|:------:|:---------------|:----------------------------|:----------------|
| **L₁** | Inner Collinear | Between primeron and parenmon, at the inner Hill boundary | Unstable |
| **L₂** | Outer Collinear | Beyond the parenmon, along the same line | Unstable |
| **L₃** | Remote Collinear | Beyond the primeron, opposite the parenmon | Unstable |
| **L₄** | Leading Triangular | 60° ahead of the parenmon in its orbit | Conditionally Stable |
| **L₅** | Trailing Triangular | 60° behind the parenmon in its orbit | Conditionally Stable |

In barycentric coordinates, equilibrium occurs when  
\[
\nabla Φ_{\text{eff}} = 0,
\]
where the effective potential combines gravitational and centrifugal components:
\[
Φ_{\text{eff}} = -\frac{G M₁}{r₁} - \frac{G M₂}{r₂} - \tfrac{1}{2} ω^2 r^2 .
\]

The positions of L₁–L₃ can be approximated by the standard restricted three-body relations, or more simply by numerical solutions of \( dΦ_{\text{eff}}/dr = 0 \).

---

### **Stability and Canonical Interpretation**

- **Collinear Points (L₁–L₃)** correspond to **transitional boundaries** between confined and ambulatory barycentric regimes (see Table § B4-2).  
- **Triangular Points (L₄–L₅)** exist only when the mass ratio  
$$
  \varrho = \frac{M₂}{M₁} < 0.03852
$$
  (≈ 25.9 : 1).
  
  In WCB, this defines a *parensic* regime with stable co-orbital loci.  
- These points often serve as reservoirs for *nodulic debris* (Trojans, co-orbitals, dust arcs) and as anchors for artificial satellites.

---

### **Canonical Terms**

- **Trioloc (triangular equilibrium):** WCB term for the L₄/L₅ stable domains.  
- **Cololoc (collinear equilibrium):** collective term for L₁–L₃ loci.  
- **Baryloc:** general term for any Lagrange equilibrium region within a parenson or sobrinon system.
