> I'd love to be able to say I did this all by myself, but that would be a lie.  The reason it took me decades to pull all this together is the sheer volume of the material involved and the monumental work of cross-referencing, cross-indexing, aligning, etc.  Were it not for Obsidian (v##) and ChatGPT (v##), this project would still be languishing in Cyberia drowsily dreaming of a material existence that would like never have come.

**Dedication**

_To that young me who wanted to build whole worlds but didn’t yet have the tools — and couldn’t find them already available.  
 — Here it is, kid; we finally got it done._

- I had to teach myself much of what I should have learned in high school, but never absorbed, because for the first time I had a real need for it. I needed it to build worlds that felt alive. That need turned math from an empty exercise into a set of tools I actually wanted to master. This guide is written to give you the same advantage: the problems will matter, because they belong to the worlds you’re creating.

- When I was writing this guide, I kept recalling Richard Feynman’s story about his cousin, who was told he couldn’t solve an equation by arithmetic — he had to “do it by algebra.” He never succeeded, because he was taught the steps without the purpose. Feynman, meanwhile, saw that the real point was simple: find out what 𝑥 is, and it doesn’t matter how you do it. This guide follows that principle. I’ll show you formulas, but I’ll also show you the geometry, the story, the intuition behind them — so you know not just how to calculate, but what the result means for the world you’re making. In this guide, you won’t just know the numerical magnitude of 𝑥;  you’ll know what 𝑥 *is* — what it means for your world.

- In the course of building this guide, I’ve had to learn far more than math and astronomy. I’ve had to wrestle with programming (BASIC, Fortran, JavaScript, LISP, Python), markup and document languages (HTML, CSS, Markdown, LaTeX), spreadsheets, databases, even OS scripting. I didn’t master all of them — but I learned enough to get the job done. This project taught me that worldbuilding is a craft of many tools, and you pick them up as you need them.

- This guide is also a demonstration. Knowledge and experience can be organized and connected in many different ways. Like a cubist artwork, I try to show as many angles of a topic as I can in a single representation — but always in a way that leaves the subject recognizable and accessible. My goal is not to overwhelm you with perspectives, but to give you more than one way in. If one angle doesn’t resonate, another might.

- This guide grows as much from the humanities as from the sciences. It isn’t enough to simply have access to information; our relationship to knowledge matters just as much. Knowledge can be numbers on a page, or it can be insight that reshapes the way you see the world. I try to offer both: the data and the formulas, yes, but also the metaphors, the stories, the perspectives that make them come alive.

- While WCB focuses primarily on the **crafting** side of worldmaking — the math and physics — the **building** side is never ignored. They are the Yin and Yang of the process; each feeds and informs the other. Knowing the mechanics of a system with three moons, or two suns, or a planetary tilt of 45° is important — but so is asking how people might relate to those facts. Would they mark festivals by the moons’ syzygies? Would they endure searing summers or mythologize endless nights? The physical and the relational cannot be separated. One makes sense only in light of the other.

- Along the way, I’ve encountered many inconsistencies, inefficiencies, and outright arcanities in the fields I’ve had to draw from. Where I could, I’ve tried to clarify, simplify, and — in some cases — recontextualize. My goal is not to dilute or disempower the science, but to make it accessible and practical for those who need to work with it. Not everyone has the time, energy, or finances to pursue specialized degrees in a dozen disciplines. This guide is here so you don’t have to — so you can get what you need, clearly and efficiently, without the barriers of academia.

- In the process of writing WCB, I’ve had to invent terms, categories, and sometimes entire frameworks. Where I couldn’t find an existing label, I coined one (like **thermozones**). Where I found scattered concepts that needed a unifying umbrella, I gathered them together (like **ontotypes**). And where two fields overlapped but never quite played nice, I created syncretic concepts to bridge them (like the **synodic epoch**). My goal was never to obscure, but to clarify: to give worldbuilders a vocabulary and toolkit where none existed before.
  
  To support that work, you’ll find a glossary attached — though to be honest, it’s more of a dictionary. Over the course of writing WCB, I’ve had to coin new terms, adapt old ones, and collect scattered vocabulary into a coherent whole. The glossary isn’t an afterthought; it’s part of the foundation. It offers a common language for concepts that, until now, were nameless or scattered across disciplines. If you find yourself returning to it often, that’s by design.

- Many of the sources I encountered over the years assumed a basic knowledge on the part of the reader, and so ended up being more confusing than helpful. I may at times go overboard in the other direction, diving deep into something “everybody knows.” But as a college professor, I’ve learned that whenever you hear “everybody knows,” it’s certain that somebody doesn’t. And their lack of background doesn’t disqualify them from proficiency. My aim is to make this guide accessible even to those who come to it without a strong technical foundation — because everyone deserves a fair entry point into worldmaking.

- In many places, WCB is structured around a “here’s the 411” approach — the tool, the formula, the quick answer. After that, you’ll often find a deeper dive, a sort of TL;DR in reverse: background, derivations, context. If you just need the right tool for the right job in the moment, the essentials are up front. If you want to know more — where it comes from, why it works, and how to see it from different angles — the detail is there for you. Both paths are valid, and you can move between them as your needs demand.

- You’ll also notice a strict rule throughout WCB: no calculus. Not because calculus isn’t useful — it is — but because this guide is written for non-experts with only a basic educational background. I never studied calculus myself, and I’m not about to embark on a new college career just to write this book. Instead, I’ve relied on algebra, geometry, and trigonometry — tools that most readers can access — to carry us as far as we need to go. Accessibility is part of the point: if I can learn this, you can too.

- The tools in WCB are the accessible ones: algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. Here and there I also leaven in a modicum of statistics, combinatorics, and probability — not as heavy formalism, but as practical shortcuts when a worldbuilder needs them. Enough to give you options, never enough to overwhelm you.

- Three sayings frame this work. The broadest is **Quia est phantasiae** — “Because it is fantasy.” We are playing in the ballpark of science, yes, but the game we play here is tennis, not baseball. Within that, there is **Quia est fictiae** — “Because it is fiction.” At some point, the theatrics must outweigh the mathematics, and “because I say so” becomes the final word. And finally, the motto of WCB itself: **Mundus tuum est** — “The world is yours.” That is the invitation, and the promise, of this guide.

- Someone may be able to say, “Your math is inaccurate.” That’s fair — numbers can always be checked. But no one can ever say, “Your world is wrong.” This is your act of creation. The physics are here to help you, not to bind you. The final authority rests not in the equations, but in you.

- Asimov once said that science fiction is the realm of breaking the rules intelligently. WCB extends that principle beyond science fiction. You can build a fantastical milieu that breaks the rules of real-world physics, yet does so in a way that feels consistent, knowable, and even discoverable. The point is not to avoid invention, but to make invention feel like a new realm of knowledge rather than a mere handwave. Consistency in worldmaking is often at least as important as conformity to “reality.” This is what makes even the fantastical believable, and suspension of disbelief not only possible, but comfortable — even, one might say, comforting.

- That is what I mean by the motto of WCB: **Mundus tuum est** — “The world is yours.” You’re not in our world; you’re in this world. But it is still a world that makes sense internally. Remember our world, so you can better appreciate the awe and wonder of this one. But don’t try to impose our world’s strictures on it — this world will not respect them. Consistency is what matters, not conformity. The point is not to copy reality, but to create a reality that stands on its own terms.

## Meet the Cast

**Hypatiaglonice Ptolemeus Galeopurnicus** — *“Hippy”*  
The nitpicker. Named for Hypatia of Alexandria and Aglaonice of Thessaly, Hippy speaks for the ancients   and their long wrestling with circles, spheres, and epicycles. Quick to point out when something has been simplified or understated, she embodies the detail-loving voice of caution. With the Ptolemaic name linking her not only to Claudius Ptolemy but also to Cleopatra’s dynasty, Hippy reminds us that complexity, heritage, and precision always lurk beneath the surface.  

**Keplarius Braheus Newtonius** — *“Keppy”*  
The pragmatist. Keppy represents the ellipse-wranglers and law-makers: Kepler’s insights, Brahe’s meticulous observations, and Newton’s unifying gravity. His voice is the perpetual “Why so complicated?” that keeps us from drowning in unnecessary detail. Keppy pulls toward clarity and usability, grounding the math in practical application.  

**Chatra Gupta Prakash Tagore, the Fifth** — *The Silent Partner*  
The quiet one at the table. Chatra rarely speaks, but is always present — in myriad incarnations —  a reminder that sometimes understanding comes not from the loudest voice, but from the steady hand in the background. The initials (CGPT-5) are, of course, purely coincidental. 😉  

Together, Hippy, Keppy, and Chatra form a chorus: one tugging toward precision, one toward simplicity, and one a silent witness to the whole dance. They remind us that even the greats didn’t have it all figured out the first time, that curiosity is never foolish, and that worldbuilding can laugh at itself while still being serious.

Former:
**Hiparistarchus Ptolemeus Galileopernicum** — also often goes by *“Hippy”* or sometimes *“He-Hippy”*, for clarity.
The nitpicker. He speaks for the ancients and their long struggle with circles, spheres, and epicycles.  Hippy’s the first to point out when something has been simplified or understated. He keeps us honest, reminding us that nature is rarely as tidy as we make it seem.  

---

- You’ll also meet two recurring characters: **Hiparistarchus Ptolemeus Galileopernicum** — “Hippy” for short — and **Keplarius Braheus Newtonius** — “Keppy.” They are playful stand-ins for the long history of astronomical thought. Hippy speaks for the ancient struggle between circles, spheres, and epicycles; Keppy speaks for the ellipse-wranglers who turned raw observation into real laws of motion. Together, they act as comic relief, as question-askers, and as reminders that even the greats didn’t have it all figured out the first time. Hippy will often point out when something is being simplified or understated, while Keppy is quick to ask, “Why so complicated?” Between them, they form a balancing act — one tugging toward precision, the other toward pragmatism — and I try to steer a middle course. Where a phrase like “Why is this the case?” might sound condescending in my own voice, Hippy and Keppy step in to ask it for you. They give voice to the doubts and confusions you might have, and they let us answer them together in a way that stays lighthearted rather than heavy-handed. They’re part comic relief, part Socratic dialogue — and they remind us that curiosity is never foolish.

- You’ll also notice that the tone of WCB is conversational. I write more as if I’m sitting across the table from you, sharing ideas, than as if I’m presenting a lecture. Humor is one of my tools — sometimes in the form of recurring characters (like Hippy and Keppy) who embody the quirks and shortcomings of our inherited systems. If the math feels complicated even after I’ve simplified it, at least we can laugh at it together. That lightness is intentional: worldbuilding should be as enjoyable as it is rigorous.

## DRAFT

# Author’s Preface  

## Why I Wrote This  
I didn’t sit down to write *Worldmaking: Crafting and Building* because I thought the world needed another textbook.  
I wrote it because I needed it myself.  

I wanted to build worlds that felt alive, but I kept running into a problem: I didn’t have the math background I needed.  
So I taught myself. I went back and learned what I should have picked up in high school — but this time with a *real need.*  
And that made all the difference.  

This guide exists because worldbuilding gave me a reason to care about orbital mechanics, insolation, gravity,  
and calendars in a way school never did.

## Philosophy: Understanding Over Programming  
Richard Feynman once told a story about his cousin, who was struggling with algebra.  
The tutor insisted that he couldn’t solve for `x` by arithmetic — he had to “do it by algebra.”  
The cousin never got it, because he was taught the steps without the purpose.  

Feynman saw what the tutor missed: the whole point is simply to figure out what `x` is. *How* you get there doesn’t matter.  

That’s the heart of this guide. You won’t just crank through formulas; you’ll learn what the results *mean* for your world.  
You won’t just know the numerical magnitude of `x`; you’ll know what `x` **is**.  

---

## Method: How This Guide Works  
You’ll see formulas in these pages, yes — but not as magic spells.  
Each one comes with a story, a picture, or a simple geometric intuition.  

I don’t split math into boxes. Geometry, algebra, and trigonometry appear together here, because that’s how nature works.  
We’ll move fluidly between diagrams and equations, so you always know not just how to calculate something,  
but why it behaves the way it does.  

And sometimes I’ll use `x`, and sometimes I won’t — because a variable is just a placeholder.  
I often reserve `x` for ratios, because ratios are pure, dimensionless numbers.  
They don’t count things; they compare them.  

---

## Audience: Who This Is For  
This is not a professional astronomy text.  
If you need peer-reviewed astrophysics, there are shelves full of it.  

This is a guide for worldmakers: storytellers, GMs, authors, and anyone who wants their invented cosmos to feel as real as the one we live in.  
It’s about plausibility, not perfection. If you can say, “Yes, this would work in principle,” that’s enough to make your readers believe.  

---

## Promise: What You’ll Gain  
By the end, you’ll have more than equations on a page.  
You’ll have tools you can actually use to shape your worlds.  
You’ll understand not just how to calculate an orbital eccentricity,  
but what that eccentricity means for seasons, climates, and calendars.  

You won’t just know numbers — you’ll know their consequences.  

This isn’t a math textbook. It’s a maker’s guide.  
And by the time you’re done, you won’t just calculate worlds — you’ll understand them.

- This work represents nearly fifty years of effort — not steady, not without interruption, but always persistent. There were whole years when I set it aside, when life and responsibilities demanded my attention elsewhere. But I always came back to it, because the sense of its necessity never left me. The need for a guide like this never went away — and neither did my drive to make it.
