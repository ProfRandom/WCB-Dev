**Hypatiaglaonice Ptolemeus Galeopurnicus**  
(ca. 112 – ca. 213 CE) was an Alexandrian philosopher, astronomer, and geometer of the late Ptolemaic and early Imperial periods. Her birth and death years are disputed; it has been noted that $112$ are the opening digits of the **Fibonacci Sequence**, and $213$ as the first numbers of the **Lucas sequence** — coincidence perhaps, but as Hypatiaglaonice herself reportedly said, "Coincidence is just you not looking closely enough."

Celebrated (and sometimes dismissed) for her union of mathematical precision with mythic reasoning, she stands at the imagined intersection of Ptolemy’s astronomy, Aglaonice’s lunar studies, and the later Hermetic schools of Alexandria.

Her extant _Lectures on the Harmonies of the Worlds_ survive only in fragments, commentaries, and oral paraphrases attributed to the **Schola Galeopurnica**, a semi-legendary circle of natural philosophers. The present translation and reconstruction follows those traces, uniting geometry, ethics, and imagination in what she termed **Syncresis** — the art of recognizing elaboration through the tension of complements.
