## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Introduces the concept of the **Roche lobe** — the gravitational domain surrounding each star in a binary system within which orbiting material remains bound to that star.  
- Defines the **inner Lagrange point** ($L_1$) as the contact point between the two lobes where mass exchange can occur.  
- Explains how material crossing $L_1$ initiates **mass transfer**, shaping the evolution of close-binary systems.  
- Classifies binary configurations by Roche-lobe occupancy:  
  - **Detached binaries** — both stars remain within their lobes.  
  - **Semi-detached binaries** — one star fills its lobe and transfers mass through $L_1$.  
  - **Contact binaries** — both stars fill or overflow their lobes, sharing a common envelope.  
- Provides a **summary table** linking each configuration type to Roche-lobe status, mass-transfer behavior, and representative system examples.  
- Presents **Eggleton’s (1983)** empirical approximation for the Roche-lobe radius ($R_L$), accurate to within 1% for most mass ratios:  
  $$
  f(x) =
  \frac{0.49\,x^{\tfrac{2}{3}}}
       {0.6\,x^{\tfrac{2}{3}} + \ln\!\left(1 + x^{\tfrac{1}{3}}\right)}
  $$  
  and defines the individual lobe radii as:  
  $$
  R_{L,1} = \mathcal{a}\,f\!\left(\frac{M_1}{M_2}\right)
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  R_{L,2} = \mathcal{a}\,f\!\left(\frac{M_2}{M_1}\right)
  $$
- Clarifies that **$f(x)$ is asymmetric**, causing unequal lobe volumes for unequal-mass pairs.  
- Emphasizes that equal-mass systems ($M_1 = M_2$) have mirror-symmetric lobes sharing a single interface at $L_1$.  
- Highlights that lower-mass stars possess **larger fractional Roche lobes**, explaining why accretion from the smaller to the larger star is common in semi-detached systems.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **$R_L$** — Roche-lobe radius (effective gravitational boundary).  
- **$L_1$** — inner Lagrange point (mass-transfer interface).  
- **$\mathcal{a}$** — average separation of the binary stars (AU).  
- **$M_1$, $M_2$** — primary and secondary stellar masses (solar units).  
- **$f(x)$** — dimensionless Roche-lobe scaling function.  
- **Detached / Semi-Detached / Contact** — binary configurations classified by Roche-lobe occupancy.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Extends **Binaries 2 — Star Systems, General** by introducing the first **gravitational-boundary function** used in close-binary modeling.  
- Provides the theoretical foundation for subsequent sections on **Roche limits**, **mass transfer**, and **accretion physics**.  
- Connects geometric configuration to **observational categories** (Algol-type, W Ursae Majoris-type).

## Roche Lobe Geometry

When two stellar bodies share a gravitational system, each defines a **Roche lobe**—the three-dimensional region around it within which orbiting material remains gravitationally bound to that star.  Beyond this boundary, the gravitational influence of the companion star dominates.  

Material that crosses the inner point of contact between the lobes (the **inner Lagrange point**, $L_1$) can transfer from one star to the other, a process central to the dynamics of close-binaries and mass-transfer systems.
### Semi-Detached and Contact Binaries
When the Roche lobes **touch** (or one star even slightly _overflows_ its own lobe and spills material through L1L_1L1​), the system becomes what’s called a **contact binary** — or, if only one star fills its lobe, a **semi-detached binary**.

| Configuration            | Roche-Lobe Status                                                                  | Description                                                                                                  | Example                       |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Detached Binary**      | Both stars are well within their Roche lobes.                                      | No mass transfer occurs; each star evolves independently under its own gravity.                              | Most wide binary systems.     |
| **Semi-Detached Binary** | One star fills (or nearly fills) its Roche lobe; the other remains detached.       | The donor star transfers mass through $L_1$ onto its companion, often forming an accretion disk.             | Algol-type systems.           |
| **Contact Binary**       | Both stars fill or slightly overflow their Roche lobes, sharing a common envelope. | The stars exchange mass and energy directly through $L_1$; the system behaves like a single, distorted body. | W Ursae Majoris-type systems. |

## Eggleton’s Approximation of Roche Lobe Radii

For practical modeling, the Roche-lobe radius ($R_L$) can be approximated by the empirical fit derived by **Eggleton (1983)**.  Expressed in a general form:
$$
\begin{align}
\text{Define: }&\quad
f(x) =
\frac{0.49\,x^{\tfrac{2}{3}}}
     {0.6\,x^{\tfrac{2}{3}} +
	     \ln\!\left(1 + x^{\tfrac{1}{3}}\right)
	 } \\[1em]
\text{Roche Lobe $M_1$:}&\quad R_{L,1} = \mathcal{a}\,
	f\!\left(\frac{M_1}{M_2}\right) \\[1em]
\text{Roche Lobe $M_2$:}&\quad R_{L,2} = \mathcal{a}\,
	f\!\left(\frac{M_2}{M_1}\right)
\end{align}
$$
Where:
- $\mathcal{a}$ = average separation of the binary stars (in AU)  
- $M_1,\,M_2$ = stellar masses (in solar units)  
- $f(x)$ = dimensionless scaling function describing the fractional Roche-lobe radius  

---
#### Interpretation
- $R_{L,1}$ and $R_{L,2}$ give the **effective radii** of each star’s gravitational domain within the binary system.  
- Because $f(x)$ is not symmetric, the two lobes differ in size unless $M_1 = M_2$.  
- When $M_1 = M_2$, both lobes have equal volumes and share a common boundary at $L_1$.  
- For unequal masses, the lower-mass star has the *larger fractional lobe* (a smaller star but a larger gravitational domain relative to its own mass).  

---
#### Practical Rule of Thumb
For typical mass ratios in close binaries ($0.2 \le \frac{M_2}{M_1} \le 5$), Eggleton’s formula is accurate to within 1% — far more than sufficient for system-design or orbit-stability work in WCB.
