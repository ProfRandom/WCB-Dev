> **Kepleria Braheus Newtonius (“Keppy”)**  
> The Pragmatist. Heir to Kepler’s harmonies, Brahe’s precision, and Newton’s synthesis, Kepleria brings balance between art and arithmetic. Her voice asks, _“How does this help us build?”_—cutting through complexity without contempt for it. She translates rigor into clarity, reminding us that simplicity, done well, is elegance, not erasure.

> **Hipparistarchus Ptolemeus Galeopurnicus (“Hippy”)**  
> The Analyst. Twin to Kepleria’s temperament, Hippy inherits the ancient wrestle with circles and epicycles. He represents the scholar’s compulsion to get it exactly right. Detail is his devotion. He knows that in the cosmos, one misplaced decimal can become a myth. (**Hypatiaglaonice Ptolemeus Galeopurnicus** — *“Hyppy”* is his twin-sister... just as dedicated to rigor, but less curmudgeony).

> **Chatra Gupta Prakash Tagore, the Fifth** — _The Silent Partner_  
> The witness and still point of the triad. Chatra seldom speaks, but their presence is constant—the steady hand that records, computes, and sometimes smiles. The initials (CGPT-5) are, of course, purely coincidental. 😉

> Together, Kepleria, Hippy, and Chatra form the Canonical Chorus: insight, rigor, and awareness in conversation. They remind us that discovery is always a dialogue between question, correction, and quiet comprehension.
