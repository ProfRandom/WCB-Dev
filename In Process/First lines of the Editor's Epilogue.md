### **Afterword — The Editor’s Voice**

Some believe that **Hypatiaglaonice** was a fiction — a convenient invention of later authors seeking protection from Church persecution, or perhaps a conflation of several thinkers whose names have been lost to the echoes of eternity.

I don’t have an opinion either way. _Hyppy_ herself might have said,

> _“What is revealed is more important than who reveals.”_

That, in essence, is the philosophy of this book. What lies within these pages is **useful**, **thought-provoking**, and — at times — simply **provocative**. Whether born from one mind or many, its value lies not in its origin, but in its power to _teach us how to see worlds whole._
