# 🧬 Animotics — The Science of Vital Order

**Animotics** is the discipline within the WCB framework concerned with the **origin, persistence, and diversity of vitality** — the study of how self-organizing, self-sustaining systems (*animota*) arise and endure across all chemistries, temperatures, and media.  

Where **Mononics** describes a world’s **body** and **Morphotics** its **form**,  
**Animotics** describes its **breath** — the capacity for life.

## 🧭 Canonical Position

| Framework | Scope | Governs | Core Question |
|:-----------|:-------|:----------|:----------------|
| **Mononics** | Matter and mass | Structural physics | “What is the body of the world?” |
| **Morphotics** | Form and behavior | Architecture and motion | “What shape does that body take?” |
| **Animotics** | Vitality and persistence | Energy, chemistry, and order | “What life can that body sustain?” |

## 1. Animotic Orders

The **Animotic Orders** divide all life systems by *compositional basis* —  
the chemistry or energetic substrate through which vitality is expressed.

| Order | Composition | Solvent / Medium | Vital Character |
|:------|:-------------|:----------------|:----------------|
| **Biotics** | Carbon–water | Liquid H₂O | Molecular metabolism, organic inheritance |
| **Xenotics** | Non-carbonic | Varies (ammonia, silicate, plasma, etc.) | Alternative chemistries or field coherence |

> *Animotics* thus encompasses all forms of vitality;  
> *Biotics* and *Xenotics* are its two primary expressions.

## 2. Biotic Realms

Within the **Biotic Order**, life flourishes under carbon–water chemistry.  
The *Biotic Realms* represent the major equilibria of this regime —  
distinct environmental expressions of the same animotic principle.

| Realm                                  | Typical Mass Range | Description                                                                            |
| :------------------------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Telluric Realm**                     | 0.3–0.9 ⨁          | Marginally viable worlds; extremophile biomes                                          |
| **Geotic Realm**                       | 0.5–1.5 ⨁          | Broadly Earthlike, stable hydrospheres                                                 |
| **Gaean Province** within Geotic Realm | 0.8–1.2 ⨁          | Optimal carbonic equilibrium; archetypal biospheres                                    |
| **Rheatic Realm**                      | 1.0–3.0 ⨁          | High-mass, dense, superhabitable worlds; robust but physiologically intense for humans |

> These Realms differ by *expression*, not by chemistry —  
> all are carbonic; each balances heat, gravity, and atmosphere differently.

## 3. Xenotic Realms

Beyond the Biotic Range, carbon-based life fails — yet other chemistries may thrive.  
These **Xenotic Realms** describe alternate modes of animotic persistence.

| Realm | Basis | Optimal Setting | Description |
|:------|:------|:----------------|:-------------|
| **Silicate Realm** | Si–O lattice metabolism | High temperature, low volatility | Crystal-lattice animota; “living minerals.” |
| **Cryotic Realm** | NH₃, CH₄, or quantum solids | Low temperature, low radiation | Cryogenic, slow-metabolic animota. |
| **Ammonic Realm** | N–H–H solvents | Cold, pressurized environments | Ammonia-solvent biota; possible in outer Brumazone. |
| **Plasmic Realm** | Ionized or magnetic structures | Stellar coronae, magnetospheres | Energy-field consciousness; Aetheric animota. |

> In Xenotics, life trades **speed for endurance** —  
> slower reactions, higher stability, and vastly extended lifespans.

## 4. Animotic Environments

Each Realm can express itself through multiple **Animotic Environments**,  
micro-contexts in which animota adapt to local energy and matter flow.  
Examples include:

| Environment | Description | Example Realm |
|:-------------|:-------------|:--------------|
| **Aerial** | Atmospheric or cloud-borne ecosystems | Gaean, Rheatic |
| **Subaerial** | Surface and shallow-hydrosphere biomes | Geotic |
| **Cryonic** | Ultra-cold crystalline habitats | Cryotic, Silicate |
| **Plasmic** | Magnetically sustained field matrices | Plasmic |
| **Vacuumic** | Free-space or asteroid-surface colonies | Silicate, Xenotic |

> **Environment** defines *where and how* life manifests  
> within a Realm’s broader thermodynamic potential.

## 5. Relation to Stellar Thermozones

Each Animotic Order corresponds to one or more **Thermozones** in stellar architecture:

| Thermozone | Orbital Range (𝒩) | Dominant Animotic Order | Canonical Zone |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| **Igniozone** | < 0.500 | Xenotic (Plasmic, Silicate) | 𝒵₁ |
| **Calorozone** | 0.500–0.750 | Biotic (Parahabitable) | 𝒵₂ |
| **Heliozone** | 0.750–0.950 | Biotic (Inner Habitable) | 𝒵₃ |
| **Solarazone** | 0.950–1.385 | Biotic (Central Habitable) | 𝒵₄ |
| **Hiberozone** | 1.385–1.770 | Biotic (Outer Habitable) | 𝒵₅ |
| **Brumazone** | 1.770–4.850 | Biotic (Outer Parahabitable) | 𝒵₆ |
| **Cryozone** | > 4.850 | Xenotic (Cryotic, Silicate, Ammonic) | 𝒵₇ |

> The **Biotic Range (𝒵ᵦ)** spans 0.500 ≤ 𝒩 < 4.850 —  
> the thermal interval in which carbonic life can endure.  
> Beyond it lie the **Xenotic Zones**,  
> where alternate chemistries inherit the cosmos.

### 💬 Canonical Principle

> **Animotics** measures the *vital architecture* of worlds —  
> the interplay of energy, chemistry, and order that makes life possible.  
>  
> **Biotics** trace the story of warmth;  
> **Xenotics**, the story of endurance.  
>  
> Together they define the living continuum of the universe.
