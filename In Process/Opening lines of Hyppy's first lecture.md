The universe is best understood through reason _and_ imagination.

Mathematics is both invented _and_ discovered, and it behooves us to bear this in mind as we begin this shared exploration.  Reason gives us the measure of things; imagination gives us their meaning.

The one draws circles in the sand; the other contemplates the nature of the sand itself.  Both reveal truths about the reality of the sand.

So let it be with our contemplations, here.

To study the world without wonder is to see a map and mistake it for the land.  
To imagine the world without measure is to sail forever and never reach a shore.

Thus, we learn to see with both eyes open â€” one to the form, one to the fire.
