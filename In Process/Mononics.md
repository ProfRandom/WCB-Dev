Three broad categories of *monons*:
- Duramons: Solid bodies from dust grains up to 0.08M⊙
	- Sub-typing handled by
		- Mass Class (measured in *terrans*):
		- Specific mass ranges
			- deniterran
			- microterran
			- dekaterran
			- megaterran, etc.
		- Monoclass (a proportional grouping, *not* a mass measure)
		- **REPLACE with monoseries or monoscale or monospan???**
			- nanomons
			- micronmons
			- midimons
			- planemons
			- intermons
			- 

- Stellamons: Gaseous bodies between ⟨0.08M⊙ ∧ 300M⊙⟩
	- Sub-typing handled by Spectral types and classes
- Peramons: Exotic bodies >300M⊙
	- Sub-typing TBD

## Clarification: Mass Domains and Monoseries

**Mass Domains** define the broad physical regimes of self-gravitating matter —
the gravitational and thermodynamic boundaries within which monons exist
(sub-stellar, stellar, trans-stellar, etc.).

**Monoseries** describe the *continuum of physical expression* within those domains:
loosely defined sequences of related bodies that share proportional structure and behavior.

| Monoseries | Typical Mass Domain | Structural Regime | Description |
|:------------|:--------------------|:------------------|:-------------|
| **Nanomon Series** | 10⁻¹⁰–10⁻⁶ ⨁ | particulate | Dust, grains, pre-gravitic aggregates |
| **Micromon Series** | 10⁻⁶–10⁻⁴ ⨁ | rubble–aggregate | Asteroids, cometoids, moonlets |
| **Planemon Series** | 10⁻²–10⁴ ⨁ | hydrostatic equilibrium | Planets, super-Earths, gas giants |
| **Stellamon Series** | 10⁴ ⨁–300 ⊙ | fusional | Stars and protostars |
| **Peramon Series** | > 300 ⊙ | trans-stellar | Exotic, radiatively unstable bodies |

> **Mass Domain** = physical regime of law.  
> **Monoseries** = developmental sequence within that regime.


"geotic", "gaean", "rheatic", while they span certain mass domains and mononic series, are *ontosomic* groups or orders

**Note on Ontosomic Orders:**  
Terms such as _Geotic_, _Gaean_, and _Rheatic_ designate **Ontosomic Orders** — categories of worlds defined by their potential to generate or sustain life.

They are **ontosomic**, not **morphologic**, classifications:

- _Geotic_ worlds are broadly habitable.
    
- _Gaean_ worlds are Earthlike and directly hospitable.
    
- _Rheatic_ worlds are superhabitable but beyond human norm.
    

Each order spans multiple **Monoseries tiers** within the **Duramonic Mass Domain**, intersecting physical and biological parameters.

In brief:  
**Mass Domains** govern _physics_, **Monoseries** describe _form_, and **Ontosomic Orders** define _life-potential._


### Canon Terminology Update — “Animo-” over “Bio-”

|Prefix|Domain|Scope|Example Terms|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Animo-**|vitality, agency, or self-organizing persistence|universal to all ontosomic systems, regardless of chemistry|_animotic_, _animosustent_, _animogenesic_, _animotic viability index (Aᴠ)_|
|**Bio-**|carbonic, terrestrial lifeforms|limited to carbon–water ontosomic domain|_biocarbonic_, _biogenic_, _biosphere_ (Earth-specific)|

> In WCB, **“bio-”** is reserved for _Carbonic Ontosomy_ contexts only.  
> **“Animo-”** is the general prefix for _life and life-analog systems_ across all Ontosomic Domains.

### Canon phrasing suggestion

_(to insert as a preface in Meta 6 — Ontosomy and Life Systems)_

> **Lexical Principle: The Animo- Root**
> 
> Within the WCB framework, the universal signifier of “life” and “vital organization” is the **animo-** root.
> 
> - _Animo-_ derives from _animus_ (“breath, motion, spirit”), connoting vitality without implying specific chemistry.
>     
> - _Bio-_ remains correct only within the **Carbonic Ontosomic Domain**, where carbon–water biochemistry is explicitly referenced.
>     
> 
> Hence:
> 
> - **Animogenesic** — capable of originating life.
>     
> - **Animosustent** — capable of supporting or sustaining life.
>     
> - **Animotic Viability (Aᴠ)** — the quantifiable interaction between Ontosomic Order and Morphotype that determines a world’s overall life potential.
>     
> 
> _In short: all biospheres are animospheres, but not all animospheres are biospheres._

### 🧠 Recommended implementation

1. **Retroactive harmonization:**  
    Replace “bio-” with “animo-” in all general frameworks (e.g., _biopotential → animopotential_, _biotic → animotic_).  
    Retain “bio-” only inside the Carbonic Ontosomic Domain.
    
2. **Cross-link:**  
    Add “see also” references at the end of _Meta 3 — Morphotypes_ and _Planemons 3 — Habitability_:
    
    > _For life-potential frameworks and animotic terminology, see Meta 6 — Ontosomy and Life Systems._
