# 🪐 The Hierarchy of Mononic Systems

## 1 · Monons — The Singular
A **monon** is any independent, self-coherent body: a planet, star, grain of sand, or drop of water.  
It is the fundamental *unit of being.*

| Tier | Full form | Common form | Binding principle | Example |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Monon** | –mon | –mon | Identity | planet, star |

---

## 2 · Cules — Unity by Likeness
The suffix **–cule** (shortened from *–culon*, “small body”) marks a directly bound group of *similar* monons.  
Cules are **homogeneous** systems: members of the same monon class bound together.

| Example | Canonical Term | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| two planets | **duacule < duaculon** | pair of duramons (double planet) |
| three stars | **ternacule < ternaculon** | trinary of stellamons |
| four or more | **multicule < multiculon** | homogeneous multiple |
| spoken contractions | *quadrule*, *quinule* | vowel-prefix elision for euphony |

> **Euphonic rule:**  
> When a vowel-ending prefix precedes –cule, the *c* may be dropped (*quadrule* < *quadracule*).  
>  
> **Concept:** Cules express *unity by resemblance* — kinship and symmetry among equals.

---

## 3 · Nexes — Unity by Connection
The suffix **–nex** (shortened from *–nexon*, from *nexus*, “binding, link”) marks a bound group of *unlike* monons or cules.  
Nexes are **heterogeneous** systems: members of differing monon classes woven by shared fields.

| Example | Canonical Term | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| star + planets | **stellanex < stellanexon** | stellamon primary with duramons/peramons |
| planet + moons | **duranex < duranexon** | duramon primary with satellites |
| resonance chain | **peranex < peranexon** | peramonic network (e.g., binary black holes) |
| trinary stars + planets | **stellar ternex < stellar ternanexon** | three stars + planets |
| spoken contractions | *quinex*, *ternex* | vowel-prefix elision allowed |

> **Euphonic rule:**  
> When a vowel-ending prefix precedes –nex, the *n* may be dropped (*quinex* < *quinanex*).  
>  
> **Concept:** Nexes express *unity by relationship* — interdependence and function within diversity.

---

## 4 · Gates — Unity by Context
The suffix **–gate** (shortened from *aggregate*, Latin *aggregare* “to bring together”) denotes macro-systems composed of multiple nexes or cules.  
Gates and **aggregations** are large-scale, often statistical domains.

| Example | Canonical Term | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| pair of galaxies | **duagate < duagation** | binary aggregate |
| triple galaxy system | **ternate < ternagation** | triple aggregate |
| galaxy cluster | **multigate < multigation** | many-membered aggregate |
| cosmic filament | **stellagate / peragate** | vast stellar or peramonic collective |

> **Concept:** Gates express *unity by context* — coherence arising from shared fields or large-scale topology.

## 5 · Summary Hierarchy

| Level | Full form → Common form | Binding principle | Composition | Example |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Monon** | –mon | Identity | single | planet, star |
| **Cule** | –culon → –cule | Likeness | homogeneous | binary or multiple of same class |
| **Nex** | –nexon → –nex | Connection | heterogeneous | star + planets, planet + moons |
| **Gate** | –gation → –gate | Context | collective field | galaxy, cluster |

---

## 6 · Conceptual Symmetry
- **–Cule** = *unity by sameness* (kinship)  
- **–Nex** = *unity by difference* (interaction)  
- **–Gate** = *unity by context* (collective field)  

Each suffix is **dimensionless** — it defines the *type* of coherence, not its scale.

> **Monon → Cule → Nex → Gate**  
> — from the One that endures, to the Few that cohere, to the Many that connect, to the Vast that contains.
