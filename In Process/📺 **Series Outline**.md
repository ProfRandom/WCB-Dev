**Episode 1 — The Shape of Knowing**  
_Meta 1: Principles_  
Hyppy introduces the idea that reality is a negotiable construct — that worldmaking begins not with physics, but with perception.

**Episode 2 — Counting the Infinite**  
_Meta 2: Math Tools_  
She demonstrates proportional reasoning, logarithmic scaling, and orbital harmonics using chalk and light projections.

**Episode 3 — Forms of Matter, Forms of Mind**  
_Meta 3: Morphotypes_  
A visually rich exploration of monons and morphologies, illustrated through sand-table models and particle simulations.

**Episode 4 — The Dance of Dualities**  
_Binaries 1–2_  
Kepleria (played by Letitia Wright, perhaps?) and Chatra appear as advanced students while Hyppy explores binaries, barycenters, and relational being.

**Episode 5 — Breaking Spheres**  
_Binaries 3–5_  
Hippy joins via “recorded scroll” (Hiddleston’s voiceover) to argue the nuances of Roche limits and gravitational strain.

**Episode 6 — Of Moons and Kinships**  
_Binaries 7: Parensons_  
Guest: Maggie Aderin-Pocock. Discussion of regular/irregular moons, primogenic vs. syllipsic systems, and mythic kinships between orbiting bodies.

**Episode 7 — Worlds Between Worlds**  
_Planemons 1–3_  
A deep dive into planet design, mass classes, and what it means for a world to be habitable — both scientifically and narratively.

**Episode 8 — The Rhythm of Suns**  
_Stars 1–3_  
Brian Cox guest-lectures alongside Hyppy about stellar structure and the poetry of nuclear fusion.

**Episode 9 — The Architecture of Systems**  
_Stars 4–6_  
Focus on resonances, solar analogs, and stability — worldmaking as choreography.

**Episode 10 — The Measure of Time**  
_Orbits 2 & Meta 4_  
An exploration of calendars, days, and epochs — how civilizations carve meaning from motion.

**Episode 11 — The Breath of the Cosmos**  
_Animotics (upcoming Canon)_  
Philosophical: when does a system become self-aware? Includes Hyppy’s reflection on “Are We the Virus?”

**Episode 12 — The Craft of Creation**  
_Conclusion & Epilogue_  
Hyppy, Hippy, Kepleria, and Chatra gather in the observatory’s atrium.
