## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines the **Roche Limit** as the critical distance from a massive primary where tidal forces exceed a secondary body’s self-gravitational cohesion.  
- Explains that within this radius, a self-gravitating body cannot remain intact and will be **tidally disrupted** into fragments or rings.  
- Provides the classical expression for the Roche Limit:  
  $$
  R_r \approx 2.44\,R_p
  \left(
    \frac{\rho_p}{\rho_s}
  \right)^{\!\tfrac{1}{3}}
  $$  
  where the ratio of the primary’s to the satellite’s mean density determines the disruption distance.  
- Distinguishes between **rigid** and **fluid** satellites:  
  - Rigid (rocky) bodies can survive closer to the primary (≈1.5–2 $R_p$).  
  - Fluid (icy or deformable) bodies are disrupted farther out (≈2.5 $R_p$).  
- Emphasizes that the Roche Limit describes the **tidal destruction boundary**, whereas the **Roche Lobe** and **Hill Sphere** describe **gravitational domains of stability**.  
- Summarizes the three related regimes:  
  | Regime | Controlling Effect | Outcome |  
  |:--|:--|:--|  
  | **Roche Lobe** | gravitational balance between companions | mass exchange |  
  | **Roche Limit** | tidal shear exceeds self-gravity | body disruption |  
  | **Hill Sphere** | self-gravity exceeds external tides | stable satellite region |  
- Clarifies that the Roche Limit applies in **high mass-ratio systems** (planet–moon, star–planet), while the Roche Lobe governs **comparable-mass binaries**.  
- Notes that tidal disruption at or within the Roche Limit can produce **rings**, **debris disks**, or **accretion streams**, depending on the system’s scale and composition.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **$R_r$** — Roche Limit radius (distance from primary center).  
- **$R_p$** — primary’s radius.  
- **$\rho_p$**, **$\rho_s$** — mean densities of primary and secondary.  
- **Tidal Gradient** — differential gravitational force across the secondary.  
- **Rigid / Fluid Satellite** — composition-dependent resistance to disruption.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Complements **Roche Lobe Geometry** and **Hill Sphere** as the third gravitational-boundary construct.  
- Provides the theoretical framework for **ring formation**, **tidal capture**, and **disruption cascades**.  
- Serves as a transition from binary gravitational dynamics to **planetary ring and debris-disk modeling** in later sections.

## Roche Limit

The **Roche Limit** marks the distance from a massive primary at which the tidal gradient across a secondary body equals the secondary’s own gravitational cohesion.  Inside this limit, a self-gravitating satellite can no longer remain intact; it is tidally disrupted into fragments or rings.

For a rigid satellite of density $\rho_s$ orbiting a primary of density $\rho_p$ and radius $R_p$:

$$
R_r \approx 2.44\,R_p
\left(
  \frac{\rho_p}{\rho_s}
\right)^{\!\tfrac{1}{3}}
$$
Where:
- $R_r$ = Roche Limit radius (measured from the primary’s center)  
- $R_p$ = primary’s radius  
- $\rho_p$ = primary’s mean density  
- $\rho_s$ = satellite’s mean density  

> **Rule of thumb:** Fluid bodies (like icy moons) are disrupted near $\sim 2.5\,R_p$, while rigid, rocky bodies survive slightly closer (~1.5 – 2 $R_p$).
