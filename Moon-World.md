# The Moon-World System

## 1. General Overview
A habitable, Earth-mass **moon-world** tidally locked to a **Jupiter-mass primaron** (“the Jovian”).  
- **Orbital period:** 24 hours (defines its solar day).  
- **Distance from Jovian:** ≈ 4.2×10⁵ km.  
- **Hill-sphere radius:** ≈ 4.2×10⁴ km (≈ 1/10 of its orbital distance).  
- **Rotation:** synchronous with orbital period; one hemisphere (the Near Side) always faces the Jovian, the opposite (the Far Side, or “Blind Zone”) never does.  
- **Axial tilt:** 0° (coplanar system) → **no seasons.**  
- **Star:** Sun-like; the Jovian and moon orbit it together once per ≈365 days.

## 2. Near-Side (Jovian-Facing) Hemisphere
- The **Jovian** dominates the sky: 19.3° wide, fixed in place.  
- **Daily solar eclipse:** ≈90 minutes each day as the Sun passes behind the Jovian at local noon.  
- **Light environment:** alternating “day,” “midday night,” and “nosun night”; the Jovian’s reflected glow prevents total darkness.  
- **Cultural implications:**
  - The Jovian interpreted as a **visible god** or **axis of creation**.  
  - Early cosmology assumes nested aetheric strata, each rotating at different speeds, with the Jovian and the world embedded together in a still, central stratum.  
  - The geometry of the Jovian’s shifting altitude with latitude proves the **world is spherical** long before global exploration.
- **Navigation/timekeeping:**
  - 24-hour day fixed by solar motion.
  - “Months” derived from periodic occultations of the **secondary (outer) moon**—“the Eye of the God.”

## 3. Far-Side (Blind Zone) Hemisphere
- **No view of the Jovian** (always below the horizon).  
- **Normal-looking sky:** Sun rises and sets; stars visible at night; **no solar eclipses.**
- **No seasons**; the Sun’s diurnal path is invariant.  
- **Year** inferred only from the slow annual shift of constellations (sidereal year ≈365 days).  
- **Possible “month”** anchored to the bright **outer moon (“the Eye”)** whose synodic cycle defines short-count calendars.
- **Cultural development:**
  - Begins with classic geocentric (Ptolemaic-like) cosmology.  
  - Eventually deduces the existence of an unseen massive body (the Jovian) from unexplained eclipses of outer satellites → **Hidden-World Revolution** (local Copernican moment).  
  - Initially embraces **flat-world** models due to lack of direct curvature evidence.

## 4. The Outer Moon — “Eye of the God”
- **Purpose:** provides both hemispheres with a visible, periodic phenomenon.
- **Orbital period (sidereal):** ≈30 hours (1.25 days) → dynamically stable under Dermott’s spacing.  
- **Orbital radius:** ≈4.9×10⁵ km (≈17% farther out than the moon-world).  
- **Synodic period (as seen from Moon-World):** ≈4.8 days.  
- **Visible from both hemispheres:**
  - Near Side: appears near the Jovian’s limb; sometimes occulted → “the Eye closing.”  
  - Far Side: small bright light tracing the night sky → basis for their “month.”  
- **Dynamics:** safely outside the moon-world’s Hill sphere; long-term stable orbit.

## 5. Dynamical Context
| Parameter | Symbol | Value / Ratio | Notes |
|:--|:--:|:--|:--|
| Orbital period (moon-world) | P₁ | 24 h | synchronous rotation |
| Orbital radius (moon-world) | a₁ | 4.2×10⁵ km |  |
| Hill sphere radius | r_H | 4.2×10⁴ km | ≈10% of a₁ |
| Secondary moon period | P₂ | 30 h | stable spacing (Dermott’s law) |
| Secondary moon radius | a₂ | 4.9×10⁵ km | +17% farther |
| Synodic cycle (Eye) | P_syn | 4.8 d | observed “month” |
| System year (stellar orbit) | P_orb | 365 d | defines “Great Circle” |

## 6. Hemispheric Asymmetry

| Property | Near Side | Far Side (“Blind Zone”) |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Visible primary | Jovian fills sky | None (below horizon) |
| Solar eclipse | Daily, ~90 min | None |
| Night sky | Dim, Jovian-lit | Dark, starlit |
| Evidence for curvature | Obvious from Jovian’s parallax | None (flat-world likely) |
| Calendar | Day (24 h) · “Eye-month” (≈5 d) · Year (365 d) | Same year; Eye-month basis for time |
| Dominant cosmology | Theological aetheric spheres | Geocentric, later heliocentric |
| Intellectual revolutions | Aetheric → Copernican+ | Geocentric → Hidden-World |
| Meeting outcome | Confirmation bias → shock | Total cosmological collapse |

## 7. Evolution of Ideas
**Nearsiders**
1. Crystal spheres → aetheric fluid strata → parallax crisis.  
2. Acceptance that their world and the Jovian co-move → double Copernican Revolution.  
3. Discovery of the Blind Zone’s “invisible” cultures triggers “Science of the Whole Sky.”

**Farsiders**
1. Flat-world and solar geocentrism.  
2. Discovery of outer-moon eclipses → inference of unseen massive body.  
3. Contact with Near-Side data unites both models → full realization of the system’s geometry.

## 8. Narrative Potential
- **Independent hemispheric storylines:**
  - Near-Side: mythic-theological cosmology and scientific heresies.
  - Blind Zone: exploration, empiricism, and philosophical revelation.
- **Unification arc:** oceanic exploration finally bridges the hemispheres, producing the shared “Reformation of the Heavens.”  
- **Reader twist:** two “separate” story cycles ultimately revealed to occur on the same world.

## 9. Key Equations

1. **Hill Sphere**
   $$
   r_H = a\left(\frac{m}{3M}\right)^{1/3}
   $$

2. **Synodic Period**
   $$
   \frac{1}{P_\text{syn}} = \Bigl|\frac{1}{P_\text{inner}} - \frac{1}{P_\text{outer}}\Bigr|
   $$

3. **Dermott’s Spacing**
   $$
   a_{n+1}/a_n \approx 1 + 0.55\left(\frac{M_\text{sat}}{M_\text{planet}}\right)^{1/4}
   $$

## 10. Summary Insight
- The system obeys real orbital dynamics yet yields radically different *perceptions of reality* between hemispheres.  
- **Nearsiders** must dethrone their visible god; **Farsiders** must accept an unseen one.  
- The physical geometry of the tidally locked orbit becomes the foundation for parallel mythologies, scientific revolutions, and eventual unification.
