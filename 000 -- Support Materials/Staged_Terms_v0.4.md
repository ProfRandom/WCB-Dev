### Exohorology (neolex)
- The study and terminology of timekeeping on exoplanets, distinguishing local units from Earth-based standards.
### Diurn (D) (neolex)
- The period of an exoplanet’s axial rotation.  
- Earth equivalent: 1 day.
### Chronum (chrona, D) (neolex)
- The period of an exoplanet’s orbit, expressed in perannum (Ⓟ).  
- Earth equivalent: 1 year.
### Cyclum (cycla, K) (neolex)
- The period of an exoplanet’s orbit, expressed in diurns.  
- Provides an alternate way to measure an orbital year.
### Hora (horae, H) (neolex)
- Local subdivision of an exoplanet’s diurn.  
- Earth equivalent: 1 hour.
### Mund (munds, N) (neolex)
- An exoplanet’s “month.”  
- Length may vary depending on orbital/rotational structure.
### Weke (wekes, W) (insulex revival)
- An exoplanet’s “week.”  
- Derived from Middle English usage (cf. Chaucer).
### Minol (minols, M) (neolex)
- Major subdivision of an exoplanet’s hora.  
- Earth equivalent: minute.
### Secol (secols, S) (neolex)
- Major subdivision of an exoplanet’s minol.  
- Earth equivalent: second.
### Sun/Solar (insulex rule extension)
- **sun** (lowercase): an exoplanet’s star.  
- **Sun** (uppercase): Earth’s star.  
- **solar** (lowercase): an exoplanet’s star system.  
- **Solar** (uppercase): Earth’s star system.
### Xenotic (neolex)
- Of or pertaining to non-traditional life forms or systems.
### Endotic (neolex)
- Of or pertaining to traditional life forms or systems.
### World (insulex, update)
- A planemo with an active endotic/xenotic ecosystem.  
- Update to existing definition to emphasize ecosystem criteria.

## 📌 Notes
- Symbol addition: Ⓟ (perannum) for orbital period notation.  
- Cross-linking required: Planemo, Telluric, ecosystem classifications.  
- Coverage linkage: Vol. 6 (Time & Travel), Vol. 3 (Planets, Worlds, SSSBs).

### Additions from *Approximating Season Lengths*
- **Sinusoidal Approximation**  
  Approximate method for calculating seasonal lengths using a sine-wave fit to declination.  

- **Kepler’s Exact Method**  
  Precise method for calculating seasonal lengths using Kepler’s Second Law and elliptical orbital geometry.  

- **SANC** (*Simple, Approximate, Notationally Clear*)  
  Guideline prioritizing clarity in approximations when exact math is unnecessarily complex.  

- **Generalized Fudge Factor (f = 10e)**  
  Adjustment factor used in approximating seasonal lengths, scaling eccentricity effects.  

- **Sidereal chronum (C)**  
  Orbital period of a planemo relative to the inertial frame; distinguished from apical chronum.  


### Additions from *Calculating Stellar Sky Paths*
- **Azimem (Z)**  
  Azimuthal intersection point of a stellar/solar path with the horizon.  
  - **East Azimem ($Z_e$):** intersection on the eastern horizon.  
  - **West Azimem ($Z_w$):** intersection on the western horizon.  

- **Azimuthem**  
  Great-circle arc through zenith connecting east to west; always 180°.  

- **Altitudem**  
  Altitude of ellipse center relative to horizon.  

- **Obliquem**  
  Half of the planet’s axial obliquity ($\varepsilon_x/2$).  

**Canon Note**: In WCB usage, the older ellipse parameters (semi-major and semi-minor axes) are deprecated for sky-path geometry. They are replaced by **Azimuthem** (horizontal span = 180°) and **Obliquem** (vertical span = half obliquity).
