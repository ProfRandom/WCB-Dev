## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines **Geotic planemos** as **habitable** terrestrial-class worlds (rocky–metallic composition) where humans can survive with minimal adaptation.  
- Establishes parameter corridors wider than Gaeans but still viable for Earth-based life:  
  - Mass (m): 0.30–3.35 ⨁  
  - Density (ρ): 0.85–1.25 ⨁  
  - Surface Gravity (g): 0.60–1.65 ⨁  
  - Radius (r): 0.60–1.50 ⨁  
  - Escape Velocity (vₑ): 0.65–1.50 ⨁  
- Emphasizes that density is tightly bounded to ensure terrestrial composition, while mass and radius are more flexible.  
- Geotics may require **atmospheric processing, infrastructure, or selective siting**, but can still yield shirtsleeve environments.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Geotic** — Habitable terrestrial-class planemo.  
- **m, ρ, g, r, vₑ** — Fundamental planemo parameters (Earth-relative).  
- **Marginal Earth-twins** — Near the edge of Gaean ranges.  
- **Super-Earths (high-gravity Geotics)** — Heavier but still habitable.  
- **Cooler, lighter Earthlikes** — Lower-pressure, lower-gravity variants.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- All **Gaeans** are Geotics, but not all Geotics are Gaeans.  
- Broader corridors allow for habitability beyond strict shirtsleeve optimum.  
- Complements **Gaean** and **Gravity One Corridor** entries by defining the wider viable zone.

> _Geotics_ are **habitable** planemos — terrestrial-class worlds where humans can survive and thrive with minimal adaptation. These planemos fall within a broader Earth-like envelope, allowing a wider range of environmental and structural conditions than Gaeans, while remaining physically and biologically viable for Earth-based life. Atmospheric processing, infrastructure, or selective location may be required, but **shirtsleeve environments** are still plausible.

**Core Feature**:
- _Density bounds_ are kept narrow to ensure terrestrial composition (i.e., rocky–metallic silicate structure), but mass and radius are permitted greater variation, producing a range of surface gravities and escape velocities still compatible with Earth-based life — particularly plants, microbes, and well-supported human habitation.   
**Implication**:
- Geotics may include:    
    - **Marginal Earth-twins** (on the edges of Gaean parameters)        
    - **High-gravity super-Earths** (with greater landmass and thicker atmospheres)        
    - **Cooler, lighter Earthlikes** (with lower pressure and gravity, but survivable biospheres)
**Geotic ≠ Gaean**:
- All **Gaean** worlds are a _subset_ of Geotics.    
- But Geotics may include conditions beyond optimal comfort — requiring adaptation or technology to sustain human colonization.## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines **Gaean planemos** as the subset of Geotics that are fully **hospitable** (shirtsleeve worlds).  
- Parameter bounds:  
  - Mass (m): 0.45–1.85 ⨁  
  - Density (ρ): 0.85–1.25 ⨁  
  - Gravity (g): 0.90–1.10 ⨁  
  - Radius (r): 0.70–1.30 ⨁  
  - Escape velocity (vₑ): 0.80–1.20 ⨁  
- Core criterion: **Earth-normal surface gravity** (±10%).  
- Introduces the **Gravity One Corridor** — the locus of mass–density pairs that yield g = 1.000 ⨁.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **m** — Mass (⨁).  
- **ρ** — Density (⨁).  
- **g** — Surface gravity (⨁).  
- **r** — Radius (⨁).  
- **vₑ** — Escape velocity (⨁).  
- **Gravity One Corridor** — Parameter-space path yielding g = 1.000 ⨁.  
- **Gaean** — Shirtsleeve-hospitable planemo.  
- **Geotic** — Broader class of human-hospitable or parahabitable planemos.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- All **Gaeans** are **Geotics**, but not all Geotics are Gaeans.  
- Gravity One Corridor acts as the **ideal comfort baseline**; deviations reduce biomechanical ease, increase escape energy cost, or complicate stability/terraforming.  
- About 17.7% of Geotics fall within/near this corridor.  
- Provides reference framework for distinguishing **hospitable** (Gaean) vs. merely **habitable** (Geotic) worlds.

> _Gaeans_ are **hospitable** planemos — worlds whose surface environments require no special adaptation for unaided human life. They maintain **Earth-normal gravity** (⟨0.90 ∧ 1.10⟩⨁), and all other physical parameters — mass, radius, density, and escape velocity — fall within tightly Earthlike bounds. These planemos support **shirtsleeve conditions**: humans can breathe the air, walk freely on the surface, and survive long-term without technological intervention.
> *All Gaeans are Geotics, but not all Geotics are Gaeans*.
### Gaean Worlds and the Gravity One Corridor
Gaean worlds are **hospitable** by definition — capable of supporting unmodified human life on the surface. But more than that, their defining feature is a surface gravity **within ±10% of Earth’s**, or:
* 0.90 ≤ g ≤ 1.10 (in Earth gravities)
#### The Gravity One Corridor
This range centers on what we call the **Gravity One Corridor** — the precise locus of all planemo configurations (_mass–density pairs_) that yield **surface gravity = 1.000⨁**.

![[The_Gravity_One_Corridor.png]]
This narrow but critical pathway through parameter space defines the zone of optimal human comfort, physiology, architecture, and biomechanical function.

> When **g = 1.000⨁**, everything else — escape velocity, radius, and structural density — falls into predictable and manageable ranges.

As shown in the diagram:
- Planetary **mass (m)** and **density (ρ)** balance precisely to maintain **g = 1**.    
- The resulting values for:    
    - **Radius (r)** range from ~0.85⨁ to 1.25⨁        
    - **Escape velocity (vₑ)** from ~0.70⨁ to 1.30⨁        
- This corridor provides an ideal baseline from which all other habitable world classes are derived.
#### Why This Matters
Approximately 17.7% of all Geotics fall **within or near** the Gravity One Corridor. Deviating too far from it — even if mass and radius are "in range" — results in a world that is:
- Less biomechanically comfortable    
- More energetically expensive to escape    
- More geostructurally unstable    
- More challenging to terraform or sustain
In short:
> **The closer a world hugs the Gravity One Corridor, the easier it is to call home.**

## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines **Rheatic planemos** as **parahabitable super-Earths**, favorable to robust biospheres but often inhospitable to unmodified humans.  
- Parameter corridors:  
  - Mass (m): 1.00–3.00 ⨁  
  - Density (ρ): 0.85–1.25 ⨁  
  - Surface Gravity (g): 0.85–1.70 ⨁  
  - Radius (r): 0.90–1.50 ⨁  
  - Escape Velocity (vₑ): 0.95–1.50 ⨁  
- **Overlap with Gaeans:** ≈13.9% of Rheatics fall within Gaean gravity bounds (0.9–1.1 ⨁), making them unusually favorable worlds with both Earthlike conditions and enhanced biospheric potential.  
- **Core Feature:** Larger, denser terrestrial bodies → broader climatic bands, longer tectonic–volcanic cycling, stronger magnetospheres, and more biospheric resilience (“superhabitable” qualities).  
- **Implications for settlement:** Human colonization possible but requires adaptation: medical mitigation for high gravity, structural reinforcement, climate control.  
- **Distinction:**  
  - All Rheatics are Geotics, but skew toward higher mass/density.  
  - Only a small subset are Gaean.  
  - Serves as the WCB counterpart to **“superhabitable” exoplanets** in the scientific literature.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Rheatic** — Parahabitable terrestrial super-Earth, biosphere-rich but human-straining.  
- **m, ρ, g, r, vₑ** — Fundamental planemo parameters (Earth-relative).  
- **Superhabitable Zone** — WCB framing of biosphere-enhancing corridors.  
- **Overlap Fraction:** ≈13.9% of Rheatics are also Gaean.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Consolidates external “superhabitable” terminology under the WCB neolex **Rheatic**.  
- Provides numeric corridors to distinguish Rheatics from Geotics and Gaeans.  
- Complements **Justifying Parahabitable Parameter Limits** by filling in the higher-mass end of the spectrum.

$$
> _Rheatics_ are **parahabitable** planemos — terrestrial super-Earths with conditions **favorable to rich biospheres** but likely **inhospitable to unmodified humans**. They may possess higher surface gravity, thicker atmospheres, and more energetic climates, often demanding mechanical, biological, or infrastructural adaptations for long-term Earthling presence. Nonetheless, they are considered highly conducive to complex, robust life — just not necessarily Earthlike.

**Overlap with Gaeans**:
- A **small subset** of Rheatics — **≈13.9%** — fall within the Gaean gravity range (0.9 ≤ g ≤ 1.1⨁).    
- These rare worlds are **massive and dense** enough to support Earth-normal surface conditions **while offering enhanced biospheric potential** — possibly the best of both worlds.
**Core Feature**:
- The **“superhabitable” zone**: larger size means broader climatic bands, more plate tectonics, greater magnetic shielding, and longer tectonic–volcanic cycling — all of which may favor biospheric richness and diversity.    
- **Human settlement** is plausible but typically **requires support**: enhanced structural design, medical mitigation of gravity effects, and climate regulation systems.
**Distinction from Geotics**:
- All Rheatics meet **Geotic** compositional constraints, but their **mass and gravity trends upward**.    
- **Not all Geotics** are Rheatic: Rheatics are a **subset of high-mass, dense, habitable** planemos.    
- Conversely, **not all Rheatics are Gaean** — only a small slice of them match that precise Earthlike window.
## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines **Telluric Planemos** as solid- or semi-solid-surfaced worlds across a wide mass range, regardless of habitability.  
- Parameter ranges (relative to Earth units ⨁):  
  - **Mass (m):** ⟨0.01 ∧ 10.00⟩  
  - **Density (ρ):** ⟨0.50 ∧ 7.00⟩  
  - **Surface gravity (g):** ⟨0.15 ∧ 8.00⟩  
  - **Radius (r):** ⟨0.15 ∧ 3.00⟩  
  - **Escape velocity (vₑ):** ⟨0.20 ∧ 3.00⟩  
- Encompasses rocky, metallic, and icy planemos: Earthlike planets, super-Earths, sub-Earths, Mars, Titan, Ganymede, Io, Kepler-20b, etc.  
- **Core role in canon:**  
  - All **Geotic**, **Gaean**, and **Rheatic** planemos are subsets of Tellurics.  
  - ~4.8% of Tellurics are Geotics; ~0.55% are Gaeans; ~3.6% are Rheatics.  
- Many Tellurics are **parahabitable**: survivable only with life support, domes, or partial terraforming.  
- Symbolic note: term derives from *Tellus* (Earth-mother), but used **structurally, not biologically**.  

**Relations to Other Types:**  
- Overlaps with **Xenotic** planemos in rocky mass range.  
- Differentiation: **Telluric = structural (rocky/icy/metallic)** vs. **Xenotic = exotic composition**.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Telluric [NEW].**  
- **Geotic [neo], Gaean [neo], Rheatic [neo], Xenotic [neo], Parahabitable [neo]** (already canonical, here reinforced).  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Introduces **Telluric** as a new umbrella category.  
- Integrates existing WCB planemo types (Geotic, Gaean, Rheatic, Xenotic, Parahabitable) under this umbrella.  
- **Status:** [NEW + EXPANDED] — Telluric is newly defined; expands canon by clarifying relationships among existing planemo classes.

# Telluric Planemos

## Telluric
**Telluric** := ⟨ m ∧ ρ ∧ g ∧ r ∧ vₑ ⟩  
	m := ⟨0.01 ∧ 10.00⟩⨁  
	ρ := ⟨0.50 ∧ 7.00⟩⨁  
	g := ⟨0.15 ∧ 8.00⟩⨁ 
	r := ⟨0.15 ∧ 3.00⟩⨁
	vₑ := ⟨0.20 ∧ 3.00⟩⨁

> Tellurics are parahabitable worlds with solid or semi-solid surfaces — encompassing the full class of rocky, metallic, and icy planemos.  
> This category includes Earthlike worlds, massive rocky exoplanets, marginal sub-Earths, and bodies like Mars, Ganymede, Titan, or large moons of gas giants.  
> It defines the geophysical domain of terrestrial planemos — whether habitable or not — and serves as the primary envelope from which Geotic, Gaean, and Rheatic worlds are derived.

**Core Feature**  
- This is a broad categorization — about **4.8%** of Tellurics are Geotics, and only about **0.55%** of all Tellurics are Gaeans — and **3.6%** of Tellurics are Rheatics.  
- These worlds possess defined solid surfaces or lithospheres, with no requirement for biological habitability.  
- Many are parahabitable — survivable with life-support systems, domes, or partial terraforming.  
- May include frozen dwarfs, massive dry worlds, or oceanic with no dry land.
**Relations to Other Types**  
- Contains all Geotic, Gaean, and Rheatic worlds.  
- Overlaps with Xenotic worlds in the rocky mass range.  
- Worlds like Mars, Titan, Io, and Kepler-20b are all Tellurics, despite wildly different surface conditions.
**Symbolic Use**  
- The term draws from *Tellus*, the Latin Earth-mother, but in this context is **geostructural**, not biological.  
- When contrasted with *Xenotic*, the distinction is about **structure** (rocky vs. exotic or gaseous), not life-hosting potential.
## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines **Xenotic Planemos** as worlds whose potential biospheres are **non-Earthlike**, supporting alien chemistries or life systems (non-carbonic, non-water-based, etc.).  
- Parameter envelope (relative to Earth units ⨁):  
  - Mass: ⟨0.0001 ∧ 4131⟩  
  - Density: ⟨0.01 ∧ 7.00⟩  
  - Gravity: ⟨0.02 ∧ 60.00⟩  
  - Radius: ⟨0.02 ∧ 11.00⟩  
  - Escape velocity: ⟨0.02 ∧ 25.00⟩  
- Emphasis: Xenotic classification is **not structural** (unlike Telluric, Geotic, etc.), but **biological**, about what kinds of life might emerge.  
- Inclusions: ammonia/methane-based biospheres, silicon-based or plasma-phase life, deep high-pressure gas giant biota, crystalline metabolic substrates, etc.  
- Exclusions: simply being Geotic or Gaean does not make a world Xenotic. A planet may fall within Gaean/Geotic physical parameters and still be Xenotic if its biosphere is alien.  
- Symbolic origin: from Greek *xenos* (ξένος), “stranger,” “outsider.”  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Xenotic [NEW].**  
- **Gaean, Geotic, Telluric [neo]:** overlapping categories, but distinct.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- **Xenotic** does not appear in earlier canon abstracts — this file introduces it formally.  
- Distinction is clear: **Telluric = structure**, **Gaean = Earthlike habitability**, **Xenotic = alien biosphere potential**.  
- **Status:** [NEW] — introduces Xenotic as a new category of planemos defined by biotic potential outside Earth norms.

$$
> _Xenotics_ are planemos whose environmental conditions may support **non-Earthlike life**, including **non-carbonic**, **non-water-based**, or otherwise exotic biochemistries. The term is not tied to physical parameters, but to the **biological strangeness** of the world's potential life-hosting capacity.

**Core Feature**:
- Xenotic classification **is not about what the world _is_** — it’s about **what kind of life it might support**.    
- A Xenotic world might be a rocky, icy, or gaseous body — but its **biotic potential lies outside** the realm of Earth-normal life.
- This is an _extremely_ broad classification: only 0.35% of planemos sharing Xenotic mass and density ranges qualify as _Tellurics_.  Gaeans share mass and density range with only 0.001% of Xenotics.
**Key Principle**:
> A world may fall entirely within Gaean or Geotic **parameters** and still be **Xenotic in character** — if its biosphere is chemically or structurally **alien to terrestrial assumptions**.

**Inclusions**:
- **Ammonia-based** or **methanogenic** biospheres (e.g., Titan-like)    
- **Silicon-based** or **plasma phase** consciousness (hypothetical)    
- **High-pressure deep-atmosphere lifeforms** on gas giants    
- **Ultra-dense crust-worlds** with lattice-bonded metabolic substrates    
- **Life emerging in conditions unreplicable on Earth**
**Exclusions**:
- Gaean or Geotic worlds are **not Xenotic** simply by shape or size.    
- Xenotic worlds **may physically overlap** with all other categories — but their **life potential diverges completely**.
**Symbolic Use**:
- From Greek _xenos_ (ξένος): “stranger,” “foreigner,” “outsider.”    
- Xenotic worlds are those where **life is not just different — it is alien**.
**Parameter Notes**:
- **Mass (⨁):** from sublunar pebbles to brown dwarf threshold.    
- **Density (⨁):** from hydrogen-ice slushes to ultra dense crystal-metallic cores.    
- **Gravity (⨁):** ~0.02⨁ (Mars-like) up to ~60⨁ (felt at inner gas dwarf surfaces). 
	- Spans everything from fragile ultralow-gravity cometary clumps to neutronium-crusted compact objects just short of degeneracy collapse.
	- This definition also accommodates highly stratified gas layers (e.g. floatable biospheres in Saturnian-class or puffy hot-Neptune exotics).
	- Any values beyond this envelope cross into **ulsic** or **hypotheticals**: black holes, quark matter, etc.
- **Radius (⨁):** up to 11⨁ to accommodate inflation-limited gas giants and Super-Jupiters.
	- Frequently exceeded by puffy planemos due to close proximity to their stars inflating their atmospheres.
- **Escape Velocity (⨁):** capped at 25⨁ ≈ 280 km/s, brushing the domain of hot-start brown dwarfs.

> These are **not bound by Earth-normal biology**. They simply represent physically plausible, self-cohering planemo-scale entities where exotic life — as chemistry permits — might arise.
## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Summarizes the external concept of **“superhabitable planemos”** (Heller & Armstrong, 2014), proposed as worlds more conducive to diverse biospheres than Earth.  
- Criteria include:  
  - **Stellar hosts:** spectral classes M0–G9, masses ⟨0.359 ∧ 0.817⨀⟩, lifetimes ≥ 3 Ga.  
  - **Planemo properties:**  
    - Mass: ⟨2.0 ∧ 3.0⨁⟩ (optimum ≈ 2.0⨁).  
    - Radius: ⟨1.260 ∧ 1.442⨁⟩ (Earthlike density/gravitation).  
    - Strong tectonics, carbon–silicate cycling, thicker atmosphere, stronger magnetic shielding.  
    - Flatter surface, shallower oceans with ~71% global coverage.  
    - Mean temperature ≈ 25 °C; O₂ concentration > 20.95%.  
    - Orbits near the center of the host star’s habitable zone.  
- Scientific rationale: slightly more massive than Earth → longer tectonic/geological cycling, better climate stabilization, stronger magnetic protection, smoother surface conditions.  
- Supported by Noack & Breuer (2011) on tectonic propensity in 1–5 M⊕ range.  

**Relation to WCB Canon:**  
- WCB does **not** use the term “superhabitable.”  
- Instead, these criteria are encompassed within **Rheatic Planemos**, which refine the same concept for WCB internal classifications.  
- External term is acknowledged for context but not adopted into lexicon.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Superhabitable [exo]:** external concept (Heller & Armstrong, 2014).  
- **Rheatic Planemos [neo]:** WCB equivalent classification.  
- **Carbon–Silicate Cycle [sci].**  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Rheatic Planemos are already part of WCB classification.  
- “Superhabitable” remains external-only, acknowledged but not canonized.  
- **Status:** [EXPANDED + EXO] — expands habitability framework with external criteria; adopts internal Rheatic equivalent.

# Superhabitable Planemos

**Definition**  
The concept of *superhabitable planemos* was proposed by René Heller and John Armstrong (2014) to describe worlds with physical, orbital, and stellar characteristics that make them **more conducive to rich, diverse biospheres** than Earth — though not necessarily more suitable for humanoid or Earthlike life.

---

**Stellar Criteria**  
- Host star mass range: ⟨0.359 ∧ 0.817⟩⊙ (spectral classes M0 – G9)
	- [[Spectral Class Base Table ✓]]
- Host star lifespan: ⟨1.656 ∧ 12.934⟩⊙ years  
- Stellar age: Older than the Sun’s 4.5 Ga but younger than 7 Ga  
	- [[Stellar Lifetimes and System Habitability ✓]]

---

**Planemo Characteristics**  
- **Mass**: ⟨2.0 ∧ 3.0⟩⨁ (optimum ≈ 2.0⨁)  
- **Radius**: ⟨1.260 ∧ 1.442⟩⨁ (maintains Earthlike density and gravity)  
- **Geology**: Larger tectonic–volcanic cycling, longer plate tectonic activity, strong carbon–silicate cycle, thicker atmosphere retention.  
- **Magnetic Field**: Stronger due to larger liquid core and higher internal heat.  
- **Surface Geography**: Flatter topography, shallower oceans, widely distributed ocean coverage (~71% surface area) without large continuous land masses.  
- **Temperature**: Mean ≈ 25 °C (77 °F).  
- **Atmosphere**: Thicker than Earth’s; O₂ concentration > 20.95%.  
- **Orbit**: Closer to the center of the host system’s habitable zone than Earth is in the Solar System.  
  - Solar System example: center of optimistic HZ ≈ 1.26 AU; center of conservative HZ ≈ 1.16 AU.
	  - [[M002 - Stars — 04 Thermozone Orbits ✓]]

---

**Scientific Rationale**  
From Heller & Armstrong (2014):  
> “Terrestrial planemos that are slightly more massive than Earth, up to 2 or 3 M⊕, are preferably superhabitable due to the longer tectonic activity, a carbon–silicate cycle active on a longer timescale, enhanced magnetic shielding, larger surface area, smoother surface, thicker atmosphere, and the positive effects of non-intelligent life on habitability.”

Lena Noack & Doris Breuer (2011) add:  
> “…the propensity of plate tectonics seems to have a peak between 1 and 5 Earth masses… a geological perspective suggests the optimal mass of a planemo is about 2 M⊕.”

---

**Relation to WCB Classifications**  
In *Worlds by the Numbers*, **Rheatic Planemos** encompass the superhabitable concept, with parameter refinements for internal consistency within WCB’s classification system.

## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines **Micromo** as a distinct category of **Small Stellar System Bodies (SSSBs)**, separate from Planemos (planetary-mass objects) and Stellamos (stellar-mass objects).  
- Establishes a **compositional/conformational taxonomy** with three main classes:  
  - **Telluroids**: rocky/metallic micromos (e.g., S-type, C-type, Vestoids, M-type).  
  - **Astatoids**: volatile-rich micromos, subdivided into:  
    - Pagooid (icy)  
    - Fluxoid (liquid-dominated, hypothetical)  
    - Ceroid (ice + subsurface ocean)  
  - **Ulsoids**: exotic or cryptic micromos, subdivided into:  
    - Exotoid (exotic matter)  
    - Cryptoid (mysterious/unclassified, e.g. ‘Oumuamua).  
- Establishes **upper bounds** for micromo classification: ≤ 250 µT (0.00025 T) or ≤ 600 km radius.  
- Distinguishes **meteoroids** as a size-only category (<1 m), separate from micromo conformations.  
- Draws parallels with familiar Solar System bodies (asteroids, comets, icy moons) while introducing new subtypes for speculative/exotic cases.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Micromo**: umbrella category for small stellar system bodies.  
- **Telluroid, Astatoid, Ulsoid**: principal micromo conformations.  
- **Pagooid, Fluxoid, Ceroid, Exotoid, Cryptoid**: subtype classifications.  
- **µT (Teras Mass Unit)**: threshold measure for micromo mass (≤ 250 µT).  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Glossary entries for Micromo and Telluroid were **newly added in v1.222**.  
- Glossary entries for Astatoid, Ceroid, Fluxoid, Ulsoid, Exotoid, Cryptoid were **updated in v1.222** to replace placeholder structural definitions with these refined compositional/conformational definitions.  
- Reinforces WCB’s hierarchical taxonomy: **Stellamo → Planemo → Micromo → Conformations**.  
- Aligns terminology with the broader WCB classification framework and avoids conflict with deprecated placeholder definitions.

### **✅ 1. Micromo is the umbrella term for all small stellar system bodies (SSSBs).**

✔ Distinct from **Planemo (planetary-mass objects)** and **Stellamo (stellar-mass objects).**  
✔ Replaces vague vernacular terms like “SSSB” with a **clear mass-based category.**

---

### **✅ 2. Two Major Conformations: Telluroids & Astatoids**

✔ **Telluroids (rocky/metallic micromos)**

- **S-Type Telluroid** (Stony, silicate-rich) → Eros, Vesta
- **C-Type Telluroid** (Carbonaceous, hydrated) → Pallas, Mathilde
- **Vestoid Telluroid** (Pyroxene-rich, volcanically processed) → Vesta, Vestoids
- **M-Type Telluroid** (Primarily metallic) → Psyche

✔ **Astatoids (icy/volatile-rich micromos)**

- **Pagooid Astatoid** (Frozen volatiles) → 67P, Halley
- **Fluxoid Astatoid** (Liquid-dominated) → Hypothetical
- **Ceroid Astatoid** (Subsurface ocean) → Ceres, Callisto

---

### **✅ 3. Ulsoid Micromos (For Exotic/Mysterious Objects)**

✔ **Exotoid Ulsoid** → Hypothetical exotic matter objects (dark matter, strangelets).  
✔ **Cryptoid Ulsoid** → Unusual, unidentified micromos (e.g., ‘Oumuamua).

---

### **✅ 4. Mass & Radius Boundaries Defined**

✔ **Maximum Micromo Mass:** **≤250 µT (0.00025 T)**

- **Based on the smallest planetary-mass object (Charon).** ✔ **Maximum Micromo Radius:** **≤600 km**
- **Tim deBenedictis' threshold for planetary-class objects.** ✔ **Everything smaller than this remains a micromo.** ✔ **Meteoroids (sub-meter objects) remain a size-based category, not a conformation.**

# **Micromo Classification System**

Micromo (Small Stellar System Bodies) are distinct from Planemos (planetary-mass objects) and Stellamos (stellar-mass objects). This classification provides clear compositional and structural categories for micromo-scale bodies in stellar systems.

### **1. Micromo Conformations**

|**Micromo Category**|**Subtype**|**Composition**|**Examples**|**Notes**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Telluroid Micromos**|**S-Type Telluroid**|Silicate-rich, rocky|Eros, Vesta|High-albedo, often stony|
||**C-Type Telluroid**|Carbonaceous, hydrated minerals|Pallas, Mathilde|Dark, ancient material|
||**Vestoid Telluroid**|Pyroxene-rich, volcanically processed|Vesta, Vestoids|Likely fragments of differentiated worlds|
||**M-Type Telluroid**|Primarily metallic|Psyche|Possible planetesimal cores|
|**Astatoid Micromos**|**Pagooid Astatoid**|Icy-rich, frozen volatiles|67P, Halley|Standard fully frozen micromos|
||**Fluxoid Astatoid**|Liquid-dominated microbodies|(???)|Hypothetical micromos with surface liquids|
||**Ceroid Astatoid**|Ice + subsurface ocean|Ceres, Callisto|Ice-dominated, but with internal liquid layers|
|**Ulsoid Micromos**|**Exotoid Ulsoid**|Hypothetical exotic matter objects|(???)|Dark matter, strangelets, other exotics|
||**Cryptoid Ulsoid**|Unknown, cryptic composition|‘Oumuamua|Unusual, unidentified micromos|

### **2. Mass & Radius Boundaries**

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|**Micromo Mass Range**|**Max Mass (µT)**|**Max Mass (T)**|**Max Radius (km)**|
|**Maximum Micromo**|250 µT|0.00025 T|600 km|
|**Minimum Micromo**|Meteoroid Scale|<0.0000001 T|<1 km|

- **Maximum Micromo Mass:** **≤250 µT (0.00025 T)**, based on the smallest planetary-mass object (Charon).
    
- **Maximum Micromo Radius:** **≤600 km**, following Tim deBenedictis' planetary-class threshold.
    
- **Everything smaller than this remains a micromo.**
    
- **Meteoroids (sub-meter objects) remain a size-based category, not a conformation.**
    

---

### **3. Structural Considerations**

- **Telluroids** are primarily rocky/metallic and correspond to asteroid-like bodies.
    
- **Astatoids** are volatile-rich, including comets, icy moons, and Kuiper Belt Objects.
    
- **Ulsoids** are exotic or cryptic bodies, encompassing extreme outliers in composition or origin.
    
- **Meteoroids** are defined **by size**, rather than conformation, making them distinct from other micromos.

### **4. Final Notes**

This classification system ensures that **Micromos are clearly distinguished from Planemos**, while allowing for **refinement based on future discoveries.** It also maintains **internal consistency with WCB’s existing taxonomic structure.**
