## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Establishes a hierarchical classification of **-moic ontotypes**: monobody categories defined by gravitational rounding, fusion status, and structural physics.  
- Categories:  
  - **Planemo [sci]:** gravitationally rounded body, no fusion; includes dwarf planets and large moons.  
  - **Intermo [NEW]:** transitional-mass bodies between planemos and stars; may fuse deuterium (brown dwarfs).  
  - **Stellamo [sci/neo]:** hydrogen-fusing stars; foundational stellar monobodies.  
  - **Supermo [EXPANDED]:** high-mass stellar remnants (e.g., black holes, neutron stars) beyond stellamo scale but sub-galactic.  
  - **Ultramo [EXPANDED]:** supermassive objects (SMBHs) in galactic centers, 10⁶–10⁹ ⨁.  
  - **Hypermo [EXPANDED]:** speculative hypermassive monobodies (>10⁹ ⨁), e.g. primordial collapses.  
- Provides a summary grid of categories, prefixes, abbreviations, and mass ranges (in Earth masses).  
- Adds the symbolic unit:  
  - **Mirandion (ℳ) [NEW]:** smallest significant mass unit, equal to Miranda’s mass (0.00001⨁), marking the threshold of numerothesiastic significance.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Planemo [sci].**  
- **Intermo [NEW].**

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- **Planemo, Stellamo** already appear in canon.  
- **Supermo, Ultramo, Hypermo** existed in mass interval tables, but this file adds full narrative definitions.  
- **Intermo** and **Mirandion (ℳ)** are new introductions.  
- **Status:** [EXPANDED + NEW] — consolidates the -moic classification scheme; introduces Intermo and Mirandion.

# WCB Canonical -moic Ontotypes
_A classification of mass-based cosmic bodies by gravitational, structural, and fusion characteristics._
## 🔵 **Planemo**
> A gravitationally rounded object in the mass range typical of planemos and planemo analogs.
- **Mass Range**:  
    0.000167 ⨁ ≤ m < 4.131 kt (1.67 demiterrans to 4.131 kiloterrans)    
- **Fusion Status**: No fusion    
- **Examples**: Earth, Mercury, Ganymede, Kepler-22b    
- **Notes**: May include isolated or satellite-bound bodies; includes dwarf planemos and major moons above hydrostatic threshold.
## 🟠 **Intermo**
> A transitional-mass object between planemos and stars.
- **Mass Range**:  
    4.131 kt < m ≤ 2.664 myt (4.131 kiloterrans to 2.664 myriaterrans)
- **Fusion Status**: Sub-stellar; may fuse deuterium    
- **Examples**: Brown dwarfs, isolated non-hydrogen fusors    
- **Notes**: Symbolic “liminal” zone; fusion is partial or temporary.
## 🔴 **Stellamo**
> A self-luminous object that sustains hydrogen fusion at its core. The foundational unit of stellar systems.
- **Mass Range**:  
    2.664 myt < m ≤ 1 hxt (2.664 myriaterrans to 1 hexaterran)    
- **Fusion Status**: Core hydrogen fusion    
- **Examples**: Proxima Centauri, the Sun, Sirius A    
- **Notes**: All main-sequence stars fall here; upper bound set by radiation pressure limits (~300 ⊙).
## 🔵 **Supermo**
> A high-mass monobody object that exceeds the stellar mass range but is **not yet galactic** in scope. Includes most known neutron stars and stellar black holes.
- **Mass Range**:  
    1 hxt < m ≤ 1 Mt (100,000 ⨁ – 1,000,000 ⨁)    
- **Common Forms**:   
     - Black Holes that have exceeded stellamo mass but not yet achieved ultramo mass
## 🟣 **Ultramo**
> A **supermassive** object — typically a black hole — existing at the centers of galaxies or as relics of early cosmic formation.
- **Mass Range**:  
    1 Mt < m ≤ 1 Gt (1 million – 1 billion ⨁)    
- **Common Forms**:    
    - SMBHs        
## 🔴 **Hypermo**
> A speculative class of **hypermassive monobodies**, potentially forming during early universe conditions or beyond current observational limits.
- **Mass Range**:  
    m >1 Gt (>1 billion ⨁)    
- **Speculative Examples**:    
    - Primordial hypercollapses        
    - Direct-collapse black holes from Population III stars        
    - Core seeds of hypermassive galaxies
### 🧭 Summary Grid (Expanded)

| Name     | Prefix | Abbr. | Mass Range (⨁)            |

**Mirandion (ℳ)**  
The smallest symbolically significant mass unit in WCB — equal to the mass of Uranus’s moon Miranda.  
It is both a numerothesiastic threshold (0.00001 ⨁) and a mirandothesiastic sigil of **the smallest quantity that still transforms meaning**.  
The name resonates with _mirari_ — “to marvel” — anchoring the Mirandion at the boundary of the measurable and the meaningful.## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines the **Anthropic Norm**: the universe and its functioning as presently perceived, absent extreme or rare conditions.  
- Closely tied to the **Mediocritic Principle of State**:  
  - The majority of matter and energy in the current epoch exists within a **statistically dominant modal band** of states.  
  - Extreme states (e.g., black holes, neutronium, degenerate matter) may be numerous but are **exceptions**, not norm-defining.  
- Key insights for worldbuilding:  
  1. **Rarity ≠ Normativity**: unusual states, even if interesting, should not define the baseline.  
  2. **Normativity = Modal, not Mean**: the “normal” universe is not the statistical average, but the modal cluster where most matter/energy exists most of the time.  
- Examples:  
  - The universe is filled with stars, but is not “mostly plasma” under current conditions.  
  - Neutron stars exist, but the cosmos is not composed of neutronium.  
  - Rocky planemos form from volatiles, but the universe remains overwhelmingly hydrogen and helium gas.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Anthropic Norm [NEW].**  
- **Mediocritic Principle of State [NEW].**  
- **Modal Cluster [sci].**  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- No prior mention of these terms in canon; both are newly introduced philosophical-structural concepts.  
- Complements existing WCB philosophical principles (e.g., Protagorean Principle).  
- **Status:** [NEW] — establishes a normative philosophical baseline for worldbuilding.

# The Anthropic Norm

The universe and its functioning as we currently perceive it, absent any extreme conditions.

### The Anthropic Norm & the Mediocritic Principle of State

> The vast majority of matter and energy in the universe exists within a narrow, statistically dominant band of physical states —  from which it deviates only rarely and locally, within the current cosmological epoch.

This leads to two foundational insights for thesiastic modeling:
1. **Rarity is not normativity.**  
    Extreme states — from black holes to degenerate matter — may be _numerous_, but they are not **norm-defining**. They are **local exceptions** to a global pattern.    
2. **Normativity is modal, not mean.**  
    The Anthropic Norm does not lie at the statistical _average_, but at the **modal cluster**:  
    the zone in which **most matter and energy exist most of the time** under current universal conditions.
Thus:
- The universe is filled with stars, but is mostly _not_ plasma.  
    _(It was **at one time** — but that was a different epoch.)_    
- Neutron stars are real, but the universe is _not_ mostly neutronium.    
- Volatiles can form rocky planemos — but the cosmos is _overwhelmingly_ hydrogen and helium in gaseous form.

# 🔑 The SANC Principle

**SANC = Science-Adjacent, No Calculus.**

- ✅ We use **algebra, geometry, and trigonometry** — the practical tools any builder can wield.  
- 🚫 We skip **calculus, tensors, and full astrophysics** — that’s outside our scope.  
- 🎯 Goal: **Rigor without rigidity.** Enough math to make worlds believable, never so much that it strangles imagination.  

*Think of SANC as your worldmaking passport: it gets you everywhere you need to go,  
but it won’t weigh you down with equations better left to astrophysicists.*
