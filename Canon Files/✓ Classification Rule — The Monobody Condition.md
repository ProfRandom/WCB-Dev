## Abstract
**Major Topics:**  
- Definition of the **–mo condition**: all WCB ontotypes (planemo, intermo, stellamo, etc.) apply only to single, gravitationally coherent bodies.  
- Scope clarification: ontotypes exclude multi-body systems, aggregates, and regions.  
- Distinction between *ontological object* vs. *mathematical abstraction*.  
- Ontological boundary rule: barycentered approximations ≠ ontotypes.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- –mo suffix = ontotype indicator (e.g., planemo, stellamo, intermo).  
- Center of mass (singular) = necessary condition for –mo classification.  
- Cryptomo, supermo, ultramo, hypermo = ontotype variants.  
- Barycenter = mathematical construct; not a physical –mo.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Canonical clarification: multi-body systems (binaries, clusters, galaxies, nebulae) are **not –mo**, even if composed of –mo members.  
- Rule resolves ambiguity: a system of planemos is not itself a planemo.  
- Complements **Monobody Mass Classes** and **Monobody Compositions** as ontotype framework foundations.  
- Ensure consistent usage: “–mo” suffix always denotes singular gravitationally self-bound entities, never systems.

# Classification Rule — The Monobody Condition

> **All WCB –mo ontotypes (planemo, intermo, stellamo)** refer exclusively to **individual, gravitationally coherent bodies** — not to multi-body **systems**, **collections**, or **regions**.

### 🔒 What *Is* a –mo
A **–mo** is defined by:
- A single **center of mass**  
- Internally unified **gravitational structure**  
- Physically continuous **volume** (or event horizon, in the case of black holes)  
- E.g., **planemos, intermos, stellamos, supermos, ultramos, hypermos**

### 🚫 What _Is Not_ a –mo:
The following are **not –mo**, regardless of total mass:

| Category                | Example                          | Why Excluded                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Star Clusters**       | Globular clusters, open clusters | Multi-body systems               |
| **Nebulae / Clouds**    | Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs)    | Diffuse, non-contiguous          |
| **Galaxies**            | Milky Way, Andromeda             | Gravitationally bound aggregates |
| **Binary Systems**      | Sirius A+B, Pluto–Charon         | Contain ≥2 centers of mass       |
| **Black Hole Binaries** | LIGO-detected pairs              | Still system-level               |
## **WCB Monobody Rule (Ontotype Scope Clarification)**

> **All -mo classifications (planemo, intermo, stellamo, cryptomo)** refer to **individual, contiguous, gravitationally self-bound objects**.
> 
> Multi-object systems — whether binary, ternary, or aggregate — are **not themselves -mos**, even if composed entirely of -mos.
### 🧠 Key Principles:
1. **Ontotype is not emergent**:  
    A **system of planemos** is not a larger planemo.  
    A **binary of stellamos** is not a single, larger stellamo.    
2. **Modeling convenience ≠ ontological unity**:    
    - For orbital mechanics, it's **useful** to model a binary pair as a single object of combined mass.        
    - But **ontotypically**, the barycentered abstraction is **not** a -mo.        
3. **Distinct gravitational fields**:    
    - A –mo has **one center of mass**, even if dynamic (e.g., fast-rotating planemo).        
    - A system has **multiple discrete gravitational centers**, even if mathematically reducible.
For instance in a double-star planemo system, it is convenient to treat the two stellamos as a single stellamo of their combined mass, centered on the barycenter of their orbits, but there are not an _object_ but a mathematical construct based on a property of the _system_ they comprise.
