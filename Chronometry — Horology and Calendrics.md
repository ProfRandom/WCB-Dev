# Earth Time

There is still a lot of debate as to exactly what time is, or even whether it exists in the way we normally think of it. As Einstein (1879–1955) showed in his 1905 *Theory of Special Relativity*, there is nothing constant or universal about it: time does not pass at the same rate everywhere, or for everyone. This is more than a psychological difference — it is a physical fact about the structure of the universe itself.

In one very real sense, time doesn’t *exist* at all. What we call “time” can be seen as a measure of entropy — the steady increase of disorder — and thus as an abstraction we use to contextualize our awareness of change. Time, in that sense, is the map we draw to make sense of motion, decay, and transformation.

All living organisms react to change, both internal and external. Even bacteria “know” when their energy reserves are depleted and it is “time” to feed. In that sense, time is universal only insofar as all processes unfold within it. Whether conscious awareness of time is necessary for a being to *experience* it remains a deeper question.

Human awareness of time likely emerged from the development of **episodic memory** — the capacity to recall specific experiences in sequence. This, in turn, allowed early humans to recognize patterns: that day follows night; that the Moon’s shape repeats in a regular cycle. From recognition came record-keeping, and from record-keeping came prediction.

The ability to anticipate future events marks a turning point in the human relationship to time. Once we could reliably expect what had not yet happened, time became not just a measure of change, but a framework for intention. It allowed us to plan, coordinate, and imagine the future — the fundamental act of civilization.

> Honestly, it must be acknowledged that, in some sense, _every one of these_ concepts is an abstraction, _entirely_ predicated on the current (i.e. the last few million years) state and behavior of the Earth.  *IF* there is such a thing as a "basic unit of time", it would be the Planck Second ($5.39 \times 10^{-44}$ seconds), but even that is defined in terms of an ephemeris second (see below), so it too is an abstraction (albeit an incredibly minute — pun intended —  one).

## Calendrics
The earliest remnants (so-far discovered) of recognizable calendar systems date back to ca. 3300 BCE in the Ancient Near East, China, South Asia, and northern Europe. They were based on an awareness of various kinds of changes and cycles: things such as the Sun rising periodically in the same place on the horizon; the Moon changing its shape on a regular basis; the weather being cold and rainy/snowy at some times and hot, sunny, and dry at others. This (along with the ability first to count and then to do rudimentary arithmetic) led to "time" being measured out and tracked in various large-scale units, ranging from longer to shorter:

- The **Year**: related to changes in weather and/or the positions of tracked locations of the Sun, Moon, stars, etc., relative to landmarks;
- The **Seasons**: related to cyclical changes in the *local* climate and weather — hence, seasonal definitions and durations are not universal the world over;
- The **Month**: related (most often) to the regular, cyclic changes in the appearance of the Moon;
- The **Week**: the most abstract of the lot; measured as fractions of a month or collections of days;
- The **Day**: measured by periods of daylight and nighttime;
- The **Hour**: subunits of the day;
- The **Minute**: subunits of the hour; and,
- The **Second**: subunits of the minute.

Let's look at these in more detail.  We'll start with the *second*, because every other time unit is (or can be) expressed in multiples of seconds.  Then, we'll work up through ever larger collections of days to the *year*.

### The Second
The second ... is defined as the fixed numerical value of the cesium frequency ($\Delta v_{cs}$), the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the cesium 133 atom, to be $9,192,631,770$ Hz.

> **Keppy:** That ... is not helpful.

Sadly, no.

But, as we've established above, there is no non-arbitrary definition of "time", and therefore there are no "fundamental" definitions of its measure.  For WCB purposes, we'll just accept that a "second" is $^1/_{86400}$ th of a day. This is called an "SI second" (_Système international d'unités_), modern form of the metric system — the world's most widely used system of measurements.

So, by reciprocation, a _day_ is $86{,}400$ SI seconds.  (This is actually an _ephemeris day_ — see below).

### The Minute and the Hour
A minute is defined as a set of 60 contiguous seconds, and an hour is defined as a set of 60 contiguous minutes, or 3600 contiguous seconds.  This is derived from ancient Sumerian circular measure, which divides a circle into 360 _degrees_, each of which is further subdivided into $60$ _minutes of arc_, each of which is yet further divided into $60$ _seconds of arc_.

> **Keppy**: Uh — 

I know, I know... don't shoot the messenger.  There's a whole other tutorial that can be written about that

### Typographical Conventions

In the following discussion we'll use superscripts to refer to units of time:
- $^s$ = second
	- Wherever you see $^s$, it refers to _ephemeris seconds_.
- $^m$ = minute
- $^h$ = hour
- $^d$ = day
- $^w$ = week
- $^n$ = month (to avoid confusion with _minute_)
- $^y$ = year
### The Day
The simplest definition of a *day* is the time it takes the Earth to rotate once on its axis.  Most locations on the planet experience one sunrise and one sunset each day — or, at least, they experience *some* variation in the position of the Sun in the sky.  Because of Earth's obliquity (axial tilt: $≈ 23.439^\circ$), how much of the day is sunlit and how much is dark depends on what portion of the year one's location is currently experiencing (the season), one's _latitude_ (how far north or south of the equator one is), and the position of the Earth in its orbit (more on this later).

An _ephemeris day_ is defined as $86{,}400$ _ephemeris seconds_ ($86400^s = 24^h$).  This is a _civil day_... what most people mean by "day" when they use the term in normal conversation.

There are two other "kinds" of day:
- The _solar day_, which is the time it takes the Sun to return to the same place in the sky, and it is shorter than the ephemeris day by $3^m\, 55.9011^s$:
	- $86{,}164.0989^s$
	- $23^h\,56^m\,4.0989^s$
- The _sidereal day_, which is the time it takes the Earth to make on complete revolution on its axis relative to the distant stars (which, for this discussion, are assumed to be "fixed" and "immovable").  It is also shorter than the ephemeris day, by $3^m\,55.9095^s$:
	- $86{,}164.0905^s$
	- $23^h\,56^m\,4.0905^s$

A "day" can be timed in several ways:
- Sunrise-to-sunrise
- Sunset-to-sunset (Judaism famously follows this custom)
- Midday-to-midday
- Midnight-to-midnight (the official span for astronomy and most civil systems)
### The Year
We skip over **weeks** and **months**, because they are completely arbitrary collections of days based on how one formats one's _calendar_ (which we'll cover more thoroughly below).

What most people mean by a "year" is $365^d$.  This is a _civil year_, and is what is shown on pretty much every calendar (electronic or otherwise) in the Western world.  However, it has been known since the ancient Egyptians (ca. 4241 BCE) that the "actual" year is closer to $365.25^d$, and this has been the official length of the year since it was decreed by Julius Caesar in 46 BCE.  This "Julian calendar" accounted for that extra quarter of a year by adding one day to the month of February every four years.
#### Leap Years

This wasn't _quite_ accurate enough.  By the 1500s, the spring equinox, which had fallen on March 21, 325 at the time of the Council of Nicaea (that's an entirely other story), was occurring around ten days "early" on-or-about March 11.  Because the Church reckoned the date of Easter (by far the more important date at the time than Christmas) relative to the spring equinox, this was a serious problem.

Pope Gregory XIII commissioned a reform to the calendar, which was primarily calculated by Aloysius Lilius (Luigi Lilio) and finalized by Christopher Clavius.  It was implemented in October of 1582, by skipping 10 days — October 4 was immediately followed by October 15.

> This is the source of "April Fools", in fact; those who kept to the "pre-Gregorian" calendar continued to observe the equinox on the "old" March 21ˢᵗ, which now fell on April 1.

The leap year formula was also revised, such that February 29ᵗʰ now occurs every four years _except for century years unless divisible by 400_.  So, 1600 was a leap year; 1700, 1800, 1900 were not; 2000 was.  The next one will be 2400; so, if you were alive in 2000, you were privileged to witness a leap century which your descendants won't experience for _four hundred more years_.

This "Gregorian" adjustment made the "official" length of the year $365.2425^d$, which is only off by about $26^s$ per year.

Britain and its colonies adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752, dropping 11 days between September 2 and September 14.  Greece was the last European nation to adopt it, in 1923.

> Another interesting historical aside: In **1896**, the **first modern Olympic Games** were held in **Athens**, organized by Pierre de Coubertin’s new International Olympic Committee. When the Greek organizers published the Games’ opening date as **March 25**, that was _March 25 in the Julian calendar_ — which corresponded to **April 6, 1896 Gregorian**.  Some international delegations (including the **U.S. team**) initially read the date as Gregorian and scheduled their travel accordingly.  By the time the mismatch was realized, they were cutting it _very_ close — the American athletes arrived in Athens only **one day before** the opening ceremonies.

### "Will the 'Real' Year Please Stand Up?"

But there are two — more "scientific" —  measures of a "year":
- The _sidereal year_: the time it takes the Earth to complete one revolution around the Sun relative to the "fixed stars" referenced above.  It is slightly longer than the _civil year_ (by $19^m\,57.7635^s$):
	- $31{,}558{,}149.7635^s$
	- $365.256363004^d$
	- $365^d\,6^h\,9^m\,9.7635^s$
- The _tropical year_: the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same declination in the sky as observed from the surface of Earth.  It is slightly shorter than the _civil year_ ($by 26.7840^s$):
	- $31{,}557{,}290.45819^s$
	- $365.24219^d$
	- $365^d\,5^h\,48^m\,45.2160^s$

For worldcrafting, the **sidereal year** is the more important: how long a planet _actually_ takes to orbit its star.  For worldbuilding, the **tropical year** is the more important: how long is one orbit of the planet _perceived_ to be.

##### Converting between Tropical and Sidereal Years
$$
\begin{aligned}
C_T &= C_S\,\left(1-\dfrac{C_S}{\Gamma}\right) \\[1em]
\Gamma &= \left(\dfrac{C_S^2}{C_S - C_T}\right) \\[1em]
C_S &≈ C_T\,\left(1 + \dfrac{C_T}{\Gamma}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
Where:
- $C_T$ = the tropical chronum
- $C_S$ = the sidereal chronum
- $\Gamma$ = the obliquity-azimuth precession cycle (See Orbits 2 for the calculation of $\Gamma$)

### The Week
The English word "week" comes from Old English _wice / wicu / wucu_, meaning " period of seven days", related to Proto-Germanic _wikōn_ a feminine noun meaning "a turning, succession, change, or series", itself from a proposed Proto-Indo-European root _weik-_ — to bend, turn, or move in a circle.

It is related to Old Norse _vika_, "change, shift, week"; Gothic _wikō_, "week"; Dutch _week_, "week"; and German _Woche (from wekō)_, "week".

A week, unlike a **day** or a **year** is not an astronomical period, but a socially defined period of time usually referencing an interval of human activity, such as work, rest, or ritual.
#### Seven Days
The earliest example of a seven-day week dates back to Babylonian astrology — one day for each of the Seven Wanderers: The Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.  This was adopted by the Hebrews and later the Greeks, and the Romans after Augustus (before that, they had an 8-day week), and ultimately became embedded in both Christian and Islamic timekeeping.

For Earth, it works as a good subdivider of the year:
$$
\frac{365^d}{7^d} ≈ 52.143^w
$$
 — which is almost exactly $52$ weeks and one day.  Using the Gregorian year:
$$
\frac{365.25^d}{7^d} ≈ 52.179^w 
$$
 — which works out to $52$ weeks and $1.25$ days.

### The Month
The modern English word "month" comes from Old English _mōnaþ_, meaning "month," (literally "moon-time"); from the Proto-Germanic _mēnōþs_, "a moon, a month," probably related to the Proto-Indi-European root _mḗh₁n̥s_, "moon, month, measure of time," from the base _meh₁-_, "to measure".

It is related to Old High German _mānōd_, "month"; Gothic _mēnōþs_, "month"; Old Norse _mánadr_, "month"; Latin _mensis_, "month", Greek _mḗn (μήν)_, "month, moon"; and Sanskrit _mā́s_, "month, moon".

So, the concept of a month is, indeed, old in human consciousness, precisely because of its association with the Moon.  Wherever one is on the surface of Earth, the Moon passes through the same sequence of phases over the same span of time.  If any span of time may be said to be "thoroughly human", it would be the **month**.

#### Period of the Moon's Orbit
##### Sidereal Month
This is the amount of time it takes for the Moon to make one complete orbit around the Earth with respect to the "fixed stars"; its current official duration is:
- $27.3217^d$

##### Synodic Month
This is the amount of time it takes for the Moon to pass through one full change of phases (from new-to-new or full-to-full):
- $29.5306^d$

The **synodic month** is longer than the **sidereal month** due to the Earth's rotation.  During a sidereal month, the Earth "rotates under" the Moon, and in order for the Moon to appear in exactly the same phase, the Earth has to complete $2.2089$ additional rotations (about $2^d\,5^h$).

The relationship between the sidereal month and the synodic month is more straightforward than that between the sidereal year and tropical year:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dfrac{1}{L_{syn}} &= \dfrac{1}{L_{sid}} - \dfrac{1}{C_S} \\[1em]
L_{syn} &= \dfrac{C_S \times L_{sid}}{C_S - L_{sid}} 
\end{aligned}
$$
Where:
- $L_{syn}$ = length of the synodic month in days
- $L_{sid}$ = length of the sidereal month in days
- $C_S$ = Earth's **sidereal year** in days

## Calendars
A **calendar**—from Latin _calendae_, the “called” first day of the Roman month—originated as the priestly announcement of the new moon and, by extension, of debts and due dates.  Over time, the term came to mean **any structured representation of the year**, a framework by which a culture names and numbers its days.

At its simplest, a calendar is a **model of recurrence**: it regularizes the rhythms of the heavens—solar, lunar, or otherwise—into cycles of civic life.  It defines what a people count as beginnings and endings, which days they mark as ordinary or sacred, and how they synchronize the work of the present with the memory of the past.
### Types
Theoretically, there are as many types of calendars as one can design, but historically three types predominate:
- Solar — based on observations of the position of the Sun;
- Lunar — based on observations of the phases of the Moon; and,
- Luni-solar — combining aspects of both solar and lunar.
#### Solar Calendars
The key component to a solar calendar is the recognition that the position of the Sun in the sky is variant, but predictable (because of the Earth's orbit and rotation).  If you note the position of the Sun in the sky (or relative to a significant landmark) at a particular moment of a particular day, and count the sunrises and sunsets between that moment and when the Sun is in that _exact_ position again, you have a measure of the **year**.  The same can be done marking the positions of the shadow of a pole in the ground from day-to-day (this is the basis of the sundial).

The Egyptians were apparently one of the first civilizations to recognize that this interval was 365 _solar_ days — but, in fact it wasn't the _Sun_ that prompted their discovery, but the bright star Sirius (Eg. *Sopdet* or *Sothis*; Gk. *Seirios*).  They noted that the rising of the star just before the Sun's brightness drowned it out in the dawn sky coincided with the yearly Nile flood, and a careful count of sunrises between any two such instances yielded 365 dawns.

> So, in a sense, the first "solar" calendar was — in fact — a _stellar_ calendar.

#### Lunar Calendars
As discussed above, the Moon "changes shape" on a regular basis, taking just over $29.5^d$ to complete one full cycle.  A **lunar** calendar is arranged according to the interval of that cycle, sometimes _ignoring_ the solar cycle, altogether.
#### Luni-Solar

However, when a lunar calendar _does_ acknowledge the solar cycle, the problem of _incommensurability_ arises: there is no integer divisor that equally divides a year (civic, sidereal, _or_ tropical) and a synodic month:
$$
\frac{365}{29.5} ≈ 12.373
$$
 — which can be interpreted as "$12$ months and $11$ days":
 $$
\begin{array}{llll}
 \left\lfloor \dfrac{365}{29.5} \right\rfloor &= &\mathbf{12} &\text{whole months} \\[1em]
\mathop {\dfrac{365}{29.5}}\limits_{-\bullet-}^{-\bullet-}  \times 29.5 &= &\mathbf{11} & \text{remaining days}
\end{array}
$$
